Cohort studies have suggested that coronary artery calcium (CAC), as estimated at chest computed tomography (CT) scan, correlated with patient outcomes. However, given that the prevalence of CAC is gender- and age-dependent, the influence of baseline confounders cannot be completely excluded. Methods: We designed a retrospective, multicenter case-control study including patients with COVID-19, with severe course cases selected based on death within 30 days or requiring invasive ventilation, whereas controls were age- and sex-matched patients surviving up to 30 days without invasive ventilation. The primary outcome was the analysis of moderate-to-severe CAC prevalence between cases and controls. Results: A total of 65 cases and 130 controls were included in the study. Cases had a significantly higher median pulmonary severity score at chest CT scan compared to controls (10 vs. 8, respectively; p = 0.0001), as well as a higher CAC score (5 vs. 2; p = 0.009). The prevalence of moderate-to-severe CAC in cases was significantly greater (41.5% vs. 23.8%; p = 0.013), a difference mainly driven by a higher prevalence in those who died within 30 days ( p = 0.000), rather than those requiring invasive ventilation ( p = 0.847). White blood cell count, moderate-to-severe CAC, the need for antibiotic therapy, and severe pneumonia at CT scan were independent primary endpoint predictors. Conclusions: This case-control study demonstrated that the CAC burden was higher in COVID-19 patients who did not survive 30 days or who required mechanical ventilation, and CAC played an independent prognostic role.\",\n          \"Introduction: This study compares the period during which thromboembolic disease develops after contact with the virus before, during, and after the pandemic. Methods: In this study, the medical records of patients with a preliminary diagnosis of myocardial infarction (MI), pulmonary embolism (PE), and ischemic stroke who presented to the Emergency Department before, during, and after the pandemic (when vaccination rates increased) were retrospectively examined. Data on whether these patients had COVID-19 or were vaccinated, the time interval between infection/vaccination and the onset of these conditions, and the prognosis were analyzed. Results: In the MI group, patients developed embolism the longest after infection and the shortest after vaccination. Among MI patients, the rate of those who received the BioNTech vaccine during the normalization period was higher than that of those who received Sinovac (p = 0.005). In stroke patients, during the pandemic, the time to post-vaccine embolism was shorter (p < 0.001). Additionally, infection and vaccination increased the mortality rate in stroke and PE patients (p < 0.001). Conclusion: This study demonstrates that thromboembolic events can occur at varying rates and durations after exposure to the virus. While the causes of thrombosis are multifactorial, contact with the virus may act as a triggering factor, even if COVID-19 does not have a direct effect.\",\n          \"Background Adequate diet and lifestyle practices are postulated to improve health and enhance wellbeing of cancer survivors. Despite the heavy cancer burden in Lebanon, little is known about the diet quality of survivors. This cross-sectional study assessed the compliance of survivors in remission with the American Cancer Society/American Institute Research Fund (ACS/AICR) diet and physical activity guidelines. Methods Cancer survivors in remission for at least 3 months and attending oncology clinics in two referral centers in Beirut, Lebanon were recruited. Adherence to the ACS/AICR was assessed by examining the compliance to guidelines promoting fruits, vegetables and whole grain and discouraging elevated alcohol, meat and energy dense foods intake. Dietary data was assessed through food frequency and lifestyle questionnaires administered face to face and through phone interviews. Anthropometrics, food security and sociodemographic data was also collected. Univariate and bivariate descriptive and logistic regressions were used to determine predictors of adherence rates to the ACS/AICR score. Results A total of 268 participants were recruited (mean age\\u2009=\\u200959\\u2009\\u00b1\\u200923 years, 83% females, 70% breast cancer). Mean time since remission was 3.2\\u2009\\u00b1\\u20094 years and the majority (72%) had food insecurity. Low physical activity and overweight/obesity were present in 65% and 67% of the survivors, respectively. Median adherence score with the ACS/AICR score was 9.0 out of 15. The majority of survivors had complete adherence to the moderate meat and alcohol consumption guidelines. However, 98% were noncompliant with the whole grains\\u2019 consumption guidelines. Cancer type, site of recruitment and education were the significant predictors of the ACS/AICR diet adherence score. Conclusion This study highlights the elevated rates of overweight/obesity, physical inactivity and the alarmingly low adherence with the whole grains consumption guideline among cancer survivors in remission. Policy makers ought to use study findings to redirect government subsidization and educational interventions in the country and physicians should stress the importance of adherence to a healthy diet during remission through counseling and timely referral.

The World Health Organization estimates that asthma alone affected 262 million people in 2019 and caused 455,000 deaths worldwide [\\n1\\n]. While the majority of patients with inflammatory diseases and immune disorders respond to oral glucocorticoids (GC), 10\\u201320% of patients do not respond even to very high doses of GC [\\n2\\n]. Although this subset represents a small fraction of the total asthma population, they account for a disproportionate share of healthcare resources and costs, estimated to be as high as 50% of total asthma expenditures [\\n3\\n]. Therefore, to provide more efficient and reasonably priced treatments, it is imperative to expand our understanding of the molecular mechanisms underlying steroid-resistant asthma and to develop novel therapeutic agents based on these insights.\\nRecently, there has been growing interest in innate lymphoid cells (ILCs) due to their crucial roles in various diseases, including allergic diseases such as asthma, allergic rhinitis (AR), and atopic dermatitis (AD). ILCs secrete Th1, Th2, and Th17-associated cytokines, which are vital for pro-inflammatory responses, tissue remodeling, antimicrobial defense, and thermoregulation [\\n4\\n\\u2013\\n6\\n]. For instance, innate lymphoid cells type 3 (ILC3s) mimic Th17 cells, sharing cytokines that are involved in inflammatory responses that are beneficial for inhibiting extracellular bacteria and fungal pathogens [\\n7\\n,\\n8\\n]. Th17-associated cytokines are known to play a major role in the development of steroid-resistant asthma, worsening disease progression [\\n9\\n]. Due to their resemblance to Th17 cells, ILC3s are thought to be involved in the pathogenesis of severe asthma [\\n10\\n]. However, the extent of their involvement in asthma remains poorly understood.\\nThis review aims to consolidate current data on ILCs, with a particular focus on ILC3s, and to elucidate their role in inflammation and their connections to respiratory conditions, and implications for asthma, particularly in steroid-resistant cases. Especially, the potential involvement of ILC3s in steroid-resistant asthma, combined with their functional overlap with Th17 cells, suggests they may indeed be a promising target for therapies. Since Th17 cytokines like IL-17A and IL-22 have shown roles in severe, steroid-resistant asthma, understanding ILC3s\\u2019 contributions could encourage further research into innovative therapeutic interventions and provide pathways to manage difficult cases where traditional GC therapy falls short.\\nSignificance of Neutrophilic Asthma\\nAsthma is characterized by an excessive presence of eosinophils, mast cells, and activated T helper lymphocytes [\\n11\\n]. Its key features include inflammation, bronchial hyperresponsiveness, reversible airway obstruction, and, ultimately, airway remodeling. The pathophysiology of asthma is influenced by a diverse range of cytokines, chemokines, and some other pro-inflammatory mediators released by structure and immune cells in the pulmonary tract [\\n12\\n]. Risk factors for asthma encompass genetic predispositions, environmental triggers, and host-related factors such as smoking, infections, diet, and gender [\\n13\\n].\\nAsthma can be categorized into two distinct immunological pathways based on biomarkers and cellular components that drive eosinophilic and non-eosinophilic (NEA) asthma. Approximately 50% of asthma patients exhibit an eosinophilic inflammatory phenotype, while the remaining patients present a non-eosinophilic phenotype, which can be further classified as neutrophilic or oligocellular [\\n14\\n]. Eosinophilic inflammatory phenotype is primarily driven by Th2 cells, innate lymphoid cells type 2 (ILC2s), and eosinophils. In contrast, non-eosinophilic asthma is mediated by Th1 and Th17 cells, as well as ILC3s, leading to the classification of Th2-high and Th2-low phenotypes, respectively. Th2-high asthma, driven by cytokines IL-4, IL-5, and IL-13, has seen more treatment options emerge, largely due to the development of biologics targeting these cytokines. However, the Th2-low category, which includes neutrophilic asthma (NA), remains challenging to treat due to its association with Th1 and Th17 immune responses, as well as increased glucocorticoid resistance. Despite the significant impact of non-eosinophilic asthma, particularly NA (Th17 type) [\\n15\\n], it has received relatively little attention in research [\\n16\\n\\u2013\\n18\\n]. Furthermore, NA is present in a significant subset of asthma patients (approximately 18%) in a large cohort study [\\n19\\n]. The NA tends to have a more severe course, higher rates of exacerbation, and increasing resistance to glucocorticoids, highlighting the urgent need for further investigation and targeted therapeutic strategies for this challenging subset of asthma. Additionally, neutrophilic inflammation\\u2019s association with cytokines like IL-17 and IL-22 underscores a pathway that is not adequately addressed by standard asthma therapies, such as glucocorticoids, which are less effective in this phenotype.\\nChallenge and Potential Mechanisms of Steroid-Resistant Asthma\\nSteroid-resistant asthma (SRA) represents a significant treatment challenge, as patients this condition show less than a 15% improvement in lung function after steroid treatment, a primary therapy for asthma management [\\n20\\n]. The main phenotype of SRA includes persistent symptoms despite high-dose corticosteroids, often associated with non-eosinophilic inflammation. About 21% of NEA patients have severe courses and are resistant to high doses of inhaled corticosteroids (ICS) [\\n21\\n]. Research has identified environmental and lifestyle factors behind SRA such as infection-induced exacerbations, bacterial and viral respiratory infections, a high-fat diet, obesity [\\n22\\n], smoking, air pollution [\\n23\\n\\u2013\\n25\\n], chronic allergen exposure [\\n26\\n], malignancy [\\n27\\n], and genetic predisposition [\\n28\\n] (Fig.\\n1\\n). SRA is characterized by persistent airway inflammation, particularly neutrophilic inflammation, which is primarily driven by Th1 and Th17 lymphocytes. Research has also identified several mechanisms for SRA. Of these, Th1 cells contribute to airway neutrophilic inflammation by secreting cytokines such as IFN-\\u03b3 and IL-12 [\\n29\\n]. Increased levels of IFN-\\u03b3 and TNF-\\u03b1 have been observed in bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) samples from patients with severe asthma [\\n30\\n]. However, large clinical trials targeting the Th1 cytokine TNF-\\u03b1 as a therapeutic approach have failed to yield significant benefits [\\n31\\n], suggesting that Th1 cells may not be the primary drivers of steroid resistance. In contrast, Th17 cells produce elevated levels of inflammatory cytokines like IL-17A and IFN-\\u03b3 contribute to Th17-driven immune responses and are less responsive to corticosteroids compared to Th2-mediated eosinophilic inflammation [\\n32\\n]. Especially, cytokines such as IL-17 and IL-22 released from activated Th17 cells induced airway structural cells (e.g., bronchial epithelial cells and subepithelial fibroblasts) to secrete neutrophil chemoattractants like IL-8 (CXCL8) and CXCL1/GRO-\\n\\u03b1\\nand subsequent recruitment of neutrophils to the airways [\\n33\\n\\u2013\\n39\\n]. This was also supported by studies with IL-17-deficient mice [\\n40\\n]. Steroid sensitivity can be restored in IL-17-deficient mice, emphasizing the central role of Th17 responses in mediating steroid resistance. Another important mechanism in steroid-resistant asthma is the NLR family pyrin domain containing 3 (NLRP3) inflammasome. The NLRP3 inflammasome can be activated by pathogen-associated molecular patterns (PAMPs) and danger-associated molecular patterns (DAMPs), leading to the exacerbation of asthma symptoms [\\n41\\n]. The assembly of the NLRP3 inflammasome gives rise to the caspase 1-dependent release of IL-1\\u03b2, a critical pro-inflammatory cytokine [\\n42\\n]. Several studies have found that the expression of NLRP3 and IL-1\\u03b2 was significantly correlated with neutrophilic airway inflammation, severity of disease, and SRA [\\n22\\n,\\n43\\n]. One of the most attractive mechanisms is that the increased expression of the glucocorticoid receptor (GR)-beta (GR\\u03b2) isoform.\\nFig. 1\\nRisk factors associated with steroid resistant asthma. Exogenous factors such as air pollution, smoking, chronic infection, tissue damage, long-term allergen exposure, high-fat diet and endogenous ones as obesity, genetic predisposition, malignancy are associated with steroid resistant asthma\\nGlucocorticoids diffuse passively through the cell membrane and bind to the GR in the cytoplasm, leading to conformational changes in GR, its subsequent nuclear translocation, and the triggering of diverse immune responses [\\n44\\n,\\n45\\n]. Notably, the GR exists as multiple isoforms, resulting from alternative splicing and post-translational modifications, each with distinct roles in glucocorticoid signaling and therapeutic outcomes. Among these isoforms, GR\\u03b1, the classic and most widely studied variant, mediates the anti-inflammatory effects of glucocorticoids. GR\\u03b1 can activate transcription of anti-inflammatory genes containing glucocorticoid response elements (GREs) in their regulatory regions, such as IL-10, annexin A1, and MKP-1. It can also repress transcription of pro-inflammatory genes (e.g., IL-1\\u03b2, IL-6, and TNF-\\u03b1) by interacting with transcription factors like NF-\\u03baB and AP-1. In SRA, GR\\u03b1 dysfunction is a central feature. This dysfunction includes reduced GR\\u03b1 expression in airway cells [\\n46\\n], impaired nuclear translocation of GR\\u03b1, and post-translational modifications, such as phosphorylation, acetylation, and ubiquitination, which alter GR\\u03b1 stability and function [\\n47\\n], and altered co-regulator recruitment, disrupting GR\\u03b1\\u2019s transcriptional activity. For example, a study showed that the level of p-GR S226 was significantly up-regulated in ILC3s following dexamethasone intervention [\\n47\\n]. Further analysis indicated that the steroid resistance in ILC3 cells is mediated by the enhanced phosphorylation at Ser226, in which MAPK signaling pathway and NF-\\u03baB signaling pathway play a critical role in GR activation [\\n48\\n]. GR\\u03b2 is a dominant-negative isoform of GR that antagonizes the effects of glucocorticoids, diminishing their anti-inflammatory actions. Unlike GR\\u03b1, GR\\u03b2 cannot bind glucocorticoids because of the absence of a ligand-binding domain but competes with GR\\u03b1 for nuclear translocation and GRE binding. Elevated GR\\u03b2 levels, frequently reported in SRA airway cells, diminish the anti-inflammatory actions of glucocorticoids by interfering with GR\\u03b1 activity. Collectively, these dysfunctions in GR signaling, combined with Th17-mediated inflammatory pathways, underline the limited efficacy of corticosteroids in managing Th2-low asthma phenotypes. This complexity highlights the need for alternative or adjunctive therapies targeting non-GR pathways in SRA.\\nNeutrophils contribute significantly to SRA\\u2019s pathology. Unlike eosinophils, neutrophils are less susceptible to glucocorticoid-induced suppression, as these drugs fail to inhibit neutrophil functions such as chemotaxis, adherence, degranulation and arachidonic acid metabolite release[\\n12\\n,\\n49\\n]. Furthermore, the ineffectiveness of glucocorticoids in inducing glucocorticoid-induced transcript 1 (GLCCI1) expression in neutrophil from patients with SRA, further reduces their efficacy in SRA patients[\\n12\\n]. GLCCI1 is an early marker of glucocorticoid-induced apoptosis whose expression was associated with the response to inhaled glucocorticoids in asthma. Reduced induction of GLCCI1 in airway epithelial cells and peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) derived from SRA patients has been linked to impaired therapeutic responses in SRA \\u03b1 [\\n50\\n]. Furthermore, experiments using siRNA knockdown of GLCCI1 in primary airway epithelial cells recapitulated the glucocorticoid-insensitivity phenotype, with a marked reduction in the dexamethasone-induced suppression of NF-\\u03baB signaling. Most importantly, a genome-wide association study (GWAS) identified a single nucleotide polymorphism (rs37973) in the GLCCI1 gene that reduces transcript expression and associates with poor glucocorticoid responsiveness in asthma patients [\\n51\\n]. Especially, animals carrying the rs37973 risk allele exhibited attenuated anti-inflammatory effects of glucocorticoid therapy in a murine model of allergen-induced airway inflammation, further implicating GLCCI1 dysregulation as a mechanistic contributor to SRA. Taken together, these findings highlight a significant challenge for treatment of SRA. Understanding its mechanisms is critical for developing new treatments that target asthmatic patients with steroid resistance.\\nInnate Lymphoid Cells and their Distinct Immune Function\\nILCs are a family of tissue-resident lymphocytes crucial for tissue homeostasis and immune responses against infections and cancer. They are distributed throughout various tissues, including the lungs, skin, intestines, liver, spleen, uterus, and secondary lymphoid tissues, with their localization linked to specific subsets [\\n52\\n]. ILCs are crucial for maintaining tissue homeostasis and orchestrating immune responses. They support barrier defense by maintaining tissue integrity and responding to pathogens, produce cytokines to regulate inflammation, and participate in immune surveillance against infections and cancer. ILCs also play roles in allergic inflammation and the formation of lymphoid tissues, making them vital for balancing immunity and tolerance across various tissues [\\n53\\n]. Different subsets of ILCs have distinct functions in the immune system, linking innate and adaptive immunity.\\nILCs are categorized according to their cytotoxic activity, cytokine profiles, and transcription factors during differentiation (Fig.\\n2\\n). The main subsets include: NK cells, lymphoid tissue inducer cells (LTis), innate lymphoid cells type 1, 2, 3 ( ILC1s, ILC2s, ILC3s) [\\n47\\n]. ILCs, along with natural killer (NK) cells, originate from a common innate lymphoid progenitor (CILP), with ILC1s, ILC2s, and ILC3s developing via an innate lymphoid cell precursor (ILCP) [\\n54\\n]. Although lack of lineage markers and somatic rearrangement of T-cell and B-cell receptors, there are characterized by the presence of CD127 (IL-7R\\u03b1) on their surface [\\n55\\n]. ILC1s produce cytokines like IFN-\\u03b3 and TNF-\\u03b1 in response to IL-12, IL-15, and IL-18, expressing the transcription factor T-bet. The major function for ILC1s is to protect against intracellular pathogens and resemble Th1 cells. ILC2s are crucial players in the immune system, primarily involved in type 2 immune responses, and involved in anthelmintic and allergic responses, and tissue repair [\\n56\\n\\u2013\\n59\\n]. They can also drive pathological inflammation in allergic diseases. ILC2 can be activated by epithelial cell-derived cytokines [e.g., IL-25, IL-33, and thymic stromal lymphopoietin (TSLP)], which are released in response to allergens, pathogens, or tissue damage. ILC2s express the transcription factor GATA3. In general, they are relatively sensitive to steroids, except for those triggered by TSLP and marked by CD45RO [\\n58\\n\\u2013\\n60\\n]. In contrast, ILC3s are similar to Th17 cells, expressing ROR\\u03b3t and producing IL-22 and IL-17 after exposed to IL-23 and IL-1\\u03b2 [\\n61\\n,\\n62\\n].\\nFig. 2\\nClassification of innate lymphoid cells based on their cytotoxic activity, cytokine profiles, and transcriptional requirements during differentiation. ILC subsets are derived from innate lymphoid cell precursors (ILCP). T-bet transcription factor is present in Group 1 ILCs, which produce TNF-\\u03b1 and IFN-\\u03b3 in response to IL-12, IL-15, and IL-18. ILC2s secrete IL-4, 5, 9, 13 depending on GATA3 transcription factor in response to IL-25, IL-33, TSLP. ROR\\u03b3t-dependent ILC3s produce IL-22 and IL-17 in response to IL-23 and IL-1\\u03b2\\nILC3s are primarily found in intestinal mucosal tissues, where they play critical roles in maintaining mucosal barrier integrity, modulating inflammation, and defending against extracellular pathogens[\\n63\\n\\u2013\\n65\\n]. Further studies demonstrated that they are abundant in other mucosal tissues like skin and lung [\\n66\\n]. They possess the ability to migrate and localize to various tissues and organs, including secondary lymphoid tissues, where they modulate innate and adaptive immune responses [\\n67\\n]. Unlike adaptive immune cells, ILC3s lack antigen-specific receptors, allowing them to respond rapidly to environmental cues, such as tissue damage or microbial signals. ILC3s can be further categorized into two major subtypes based on the expression of natural cytotoxicity receptors (NCR): (1) NCR\\n+\\nILC3s: These cells predominantly produce IL-22 and are associated with tissue repair and epithelial barrier maintenance. In mice, NCR is represented by NKp46, while in humans, it corresponds to NKp44, (2) NCR\\n\\u2212\\nILC3s: A heterogeneous subgroup that primarily produces both IL-17 and IL-22, with roles in inflammation and defense against extracellular pathogens [\\n33\\n]. This functional distinction underscores the complexity of ILC3 biology and highlights their ability to respond to diverse environmental cues, making them key players in mucosal immunity across multiple organ systems.\\nGroup 3 Innate Lymphoid Cells and Human Diseases\\nILC3s participate in several human diseases, primarily those associated with inflammation and mucosal barrier dysfunction [\\n63\\n\\u2013\\n65\\n]. They are crucial for mucosal immunity and inflammation, and dysregulation of ILC3 can lead to both protective and pathogenic roles across various conditions [\\n67\\n]. There are several key diseases associated with ILC3s such as Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Diseases (COPD) and NEA [\\n68\\n], ulcerative colitis (UC) [\\n69\\n], tumor development [\\n70\\n], rheumatoid arthritis [\\n71\\n], psoriasis [\\n72\\n,\\n73\\n], osteoproliferation [\\n74\\n], and multiple sclerosis sclerosis [\\n75\\n\\u2013\\n77\\n] (Fig.\\n3\\n). ILC3s might play a role in the pathogenesis of COPD, particularly in exacerbations characterized by increased neutrophilic inflammation [\\n68\\n]. By producing IL-17, ILC3s may contribute to chronic airway inflammation, mucus hypersecretion, and tissue remodeling observed in COPD patients, especially those who are smokers or have frequent exacerbations. ILC3s also play a role in UC [\\n69\\n]. ILC3 maintain intestinal barrier integrity through the generation of IL-22, IL-17 and GM-CSF, which promotes epithelial cell repair and antimicrobial peptide secretion. However, dysregulation of ILC3s give rise to the increased recruitment of neutrophils due to producing excessive IL-17 and other pro-inflammatory cytokines and disrupt E-cadherin and junctional adhesion molecule-like molecule, leading to the enhancement of epithelial permeability [\\n69\\n]. Studies have shown an imbalance in ILC3 populations and a delayed reconstruction of damaged intestinal barrier and prolonged inflammation in patients with inflammatory ulceration (IU). Furthermore, ILC3s contribute to joint inflammation in rheumatoid arthritis by producing IL-17. An increased proportion of C-C chemokine receptor type 6 positive (CCR6\\n+\\n) ILC3s to total ILCs has been observed noted in rheumatoid arthritis relative to non-arthritic joints. These CCR6\\n+\\nILC3s expresse significantly higher levels of IL-17A and IL-22 mRNA, and levels of CCR6\\n+\\nILC3s in synovial fluid are positively correlated with tender joint counts and swollen joint counts [\\n71\\n]. Interestingly, therapeutics targeting IL-17 have been effective in treating psoriasis, highlighting the involvement of ILC3s in its pathogenesis. Similarly, ILC3s are also found in higher numbers in psoriatic skin lesion, and dysregulation of ILC3 has been linked to psoriasis [\\n72\\n]. It is evident that ILC3s contribute to the pathogenesis of psoriasis, a chronic skin condition characterized by scaly, inflamed patches, and increased levels of IL-17A [\\n73\\n]. ILC3s also play dual roles in cancer, tumor-promoting and tumor-suppressing roles [\\n70\\n]. On the one hand, IL-17A released by ILC3s favor immune evasion and tumor growth. On the other hand, IL-22 released by ILC3s supports tissue repair and barrier integrity, which can be protective. Dysregulation of ILC3s has been observed in colorectal cancer, and they may influence tumor progression and the immune microenvironment. Lastly and importantly, ILC3s are implicated in the pathogenesis of NEA [\\n47\\n]. Taken together, because of the significance of ILC3s in different human diseases, particularly NEA, ILC3s have been a potential target for developing new therapies aimed at treating difficult-to-manage asthma cases.\\nFig. 3\\nGroup 3 Innate Lymphoid Cells and different human diseases through various mechanisms. ILC3s dysfunction in gastrointestinal mucosa causes conditions such as ulcerative colitis, Crohn\\u2019s disease and increases the risk of colorectal cancer. In respiratory tract, they are associated with COPD, non-eosinophilic asthma. Furthermore, dysregulation of these cells positively correlates with severity of rheumatoid arthritis, psoriatic arthritis and psoriasis\\nGroup 3 Innate Lymphoid Cells and Steroid Resistant Asthma\\nEmerging evidence implicates ILC3s in the pathogenesis of asthma, particularly severe and steroid-resistant forms [\\n47\\n,\\n78\\n,\\n79\\n]. ILC3s were given less attention in the past due to their small proportion in the lung tissues [\\n80\\n]. Recent study provided evidence that ILC3s are the dominant subsets within the lung-draining mediastinal lymph nodes (MedLNs) besides being present in the lung parenchyma and suggested that ILC3s are critical subsets involving in the regulation of immune responses [\\n81\\n]. Similar conclusions were drawn in human populations, where the frequency of ILC3 in the MedLNs of healthy donor individuals was significantly higher than that of ILC2 [\\n81\\n], and was positively correlated with peripheral neutrophil counts [\\n82\\n]. ILC3s are more activated and migrated to the lungs in severe asthma patients than in mild asthma patients [\\n83\\n]. It was also found that the expansion of CCR6\\n+\\nILC3 and IL-17A production in the lungs have been associated with AHR. Smoking is also associated with significantly higher frequencies ILC3 in the sputum [\\n84\\n]. Further analysis demonstrated that frequency of ILC3s was positively correlated with circulating neutrophils and M1 alveolar macrophages in uncontrolled severe asthma, implying that ILC3s may aggravate non-allergic inflammation and the severity of asthma. Indeed, ILC3s have been recognized to be one of the central players in the development of NEA due to their production of IL-17 and IL-22[\\n68\\n]. Of interest, increased IL-22 levels in the airways of severe asthma patients have been correlated with disease severity and may play a significant role in epithelial barrier disruption and inflammation [\\n85\\n]. Consistently, increased IL-17\\n+\\nILC3s, a cell type that has not been linked previously with airways diseases, were also observed in the BALF of patients with asthma compared to healthy controls [\\n86\\n]. Furthermore, this study also demonstrated that an ILC3\\u2013IL-1\\u03b2\\u2013NLRP3 inflammasome axis plays a key role in the diet-induced obesity induced development of airway hyperresponsiveness (AHR) [\\n86\\n]. These findings underscore the potential contribution of ILC3s to the pathophysiology of asthma. Most interestingly, ILC3s are increasingly implicated in the development of SRA, primarily due to their ability to produce IL-17, which can be poorly responsive to corticosteroid treatment [\\n47\\n]. However, little is known about how ILC3s is involved in the neutrophilic airway inflammation and steroid resistance. It has been hypothesized that IL-1\\u03b2 overproduction caused by activated NLRP3 inflammasome promotes IL-17A release from ILC3s, thereby aggravating neutrophilic airway inflammation in mice [\\n87\\n] (Fig.\\n4\\n). Especially, the increased ILC3s were observed in airway of NEA mouse models and play an essential role in recruiting neutrophils (e.g.,\\nIL-17A\\n,\\nIL-22 CXCL1\\n,\\nCXCL8\\n) and subsequent neutrophilic airway inflammation (\\ne.g\\n, disrupting tight junction, secretion of inflammation cytokines (e.g.,\\nIL-1\\u03b2\\n,\\nIL-8\\n) [\\n87\\n]. Mechanistically, it has been suggested that IL-1\\u03b2 stimulation remarkably enhanced the release of CXCL8 and CXCL1 from ILC3s via activation of p65 NF-\\u03baB and p38/JNK MAPK signaling pathways, and these ILC3-derived neutrophil chemoattractants could lead to the insensitation of dexamethasone treatment [\\n47\\n]. This was further supported by OVA/viral-induced mouse model of asthma that chemoattractants released directly from ILC3s contribute to airway neutrophilic inflammation [\\n88\\n]. These findings support the important role of ILC3s in neutrophilic inflammation and the subsequent steroid resistance. However, recent evidence indicates that GCs may modulate IL-22 production by ILC3s under conditions such as physical or psychological stress [\\n89\\n]. For example, using MNK3 [\\n90\\n], an ILC3-like cell line that produces high levels of IL-22 but not IL-17, it was demonstrated that dexamethasone suppresses IL-23-mediated IL-22 production. Another study demonstrated that ILC3s can limit a concomitant Th17 cell response and airway neutrophilia [\\n81\\n], which may serve as a counterregulatory mechanism under certain conditions. These findings challenge the notion of steroid insensitivity in ILC3s and this duality reflects the intricate balance between protective and pathogenic roles of ILC3s in the lung, potentially influenced by the inflammatory milieu, cytokine environment, and interactions with other immune cells. Taken together, these researches underscore the complexity of ILC3 responses in inflammation and steroid resistance, warranting further investigation into their role in asthma pathophysiology.\\nFig. 4\\nPotential mechanisms underlying the involvement of ILC3s in the neutrophilic airway inflammation, barrier dysfunction, and steroid resistance. Repeatedly environmental exposures can activate NLRP3-Caspase 1 and promote IL-1\\u03b2 release from bronchial epithelium, thereby inducing ILC3s cytokine production (e.g., IL-17A, IL-22, CXCL8/CXCL1) via p65 NF-\\u03baB and p38/JNK MAPK signaling pathways. These cytokines/chemokines recruit neutrophils into the airways and contribute to airway inflammation and steroid resistant asthma. NLRP3: NOD-like receptor family pyrin domain containing 3; NETs: Neutrophil Extracellular Traps; GR-beta: Glucocorticoid receptor-beta\\nTherapeutic Biologics and Steroid-Resistant Asthma\\nThe current asthma treatments available are based on type 2 allergic asthma, such as anti-IL-5 and anti-IgE therapies, which have shown success in eosinophilic asthma but fail to address the mechanisms driving neutrophilic, Th17/ILC3-dominated asthma. Thus, there is an urgent need for targeted therapies in SRA, especially for non-eosinophilic forms that don\\u2019t respond well to Th2 immune-targeted treatments. In fact, several approaches have been investigated to target key pathways in Th2-low asthma. Particularly, few biologics have shown their therapeutic roles in improving long function, asthma control, and quality of life in patients with severe, uncontrolled asthma [\\n91\\n], reduced exacerbations in patients with moderate asthma [\\n92\\n], and improved airway hyperresponsiveness in small pilot studies [\\n93\\n,\\n94\\n]. While no biologics are available directly targeting ILC3s, there are several therapeutic biologics targeting ILC3 triggers (e.g., IL-1\\u03b2 [\\n95\\n,\\n96\\n], and IL-23 [\\n91\\n,\\n92\\n], inflammatory mediators released from ILC3s (e.g., IL-17A [\\n93\\n,\\n94\\n], IL-22 [\\n97\\n]), and ILC3 transcription al factor ROR\\u03b3t [\\n98\\n] (Table\\n1\\n).\\nTable 1\\nTherapeutic targets for steroid-resistant asthma\\nCommercial name\\nTarget\\nDrug type\\nComment\\nTezepelumab\\nTSLP\\nMonoclonal antibody\\nImproved lung function, asthma control, and health-related quality of life in patients with severe, uncontrolled asthma [\\n99\\n].\\nInfliximab\\nTNF-\\u03b1\\nMonoclonal antibody\\nReduced exacerbations in patients with moderate asthma, but not powered sufficiently to make definite conclusions [\\n100\\n]\\nGolimumab\\nTNF-\\u03b1\\nMonoclonal antibody\\nNo reduction in exacerbations or improvement in lung function, but sepsis developed [\\n31\\n].\\nEtanercept\\nTNF-\\u03b1\\nTNF blocker\\nImproved airway hyperresponsiveness in small pilot studies [\\n101\\n,\\n102\\n]\\nRisankizumab\\nIL-23\\nMonoclonal antibody\\nNo beneficial in severe asthma [\\n91\\n].\\nUstekinumab\\nIL-23\\nMonoclonal antibody\\nEffective for asthma while treating other autoimmune diseases in case report [\\n92\\n].\\nTocilizumab\\nIL-6\\nMonoclonal antibody\\nEffectively abrogate TDI-induced airway inflammation and remodeling, have potential therapy in severe asthma [\\n103\\n].\\nAnakinra\\nIL-1R\\nIL-1 receptor antagonist\\nTreatment of asthma with neutrophil predominance [\\n104\\n].\\nCanakinumab\\nIL-1\\u03b2\\nMonoclonal antibody\\nClinical trial phase [\\n95\\n].\\nBrodalumab\\nIL-17R\\u03b1\\nMonoclonal antibody\\nNo improvement in lung function [\\n105\\n].\\nSecukinumab\\nIL-17A\\nMonoclonal antibody\\nNo improvements in ACQ scores [\\n93\\n].\\nCJM112\\nIL-17A\\nMonoclonal antibody\\nSignificant improvements in ACQ6 and ACQ7 scores in Phase II trial [\\n94\\n].\\nFezakinumab\\nIL-22\\nMonoclonal antibody\\nPotential therapeutic effect in severe asthma[\\n97\\n].\\nBIX119\\nROR\\u03b3t\\nROR\\u03b3t inhibitor\\nImproved both HDM-induced, acetylcholine provoked AHR and pulmonary mechanics; reduction of airway neutrophils [\\n98\\n].\\nMasitinib\\np38 MAPK tyrosine kinase\\nc-kit and PDGF-receptor tyrosine kinase inhibitor\\nImproved ACQ score [\\n106\\n].\\nIL-17/IL-17 Receptor Blockade\\nIL-17 is associated with neutrophilic inflammation and steroid resistance. Targeting IL-17 or its receptor could help in reducing the recruitment and activation of neutrophils in steroid-resistant asthma. In a randomized, placebo-controlled study, brodalumab, a human anti-IL-17 receptor monoclonal antibody, showed produced no treatment effect on moderate to severe asthma [\\n105\\n]. Secukinumab targeting IL-17A had no improvements in asthma control questionnaire (ACQ) in patients with uncontrolled asthma [\\n107\\n]. Similarly, secukinumab failed to attenuate ozone-induced airway neutrophilia in healthy volunteers [\\n108\\n]. In contrast, another formulation of secukinumab, CJM112, demonstrated a significant improvement in ACQ6 and ACQ7 scores compared to placebo, but no improvement was found for FEV1 [\\n109\\n].\\nIL-22 Blockade\\nIL-22 plays a dual role in inflammation and tissue repair, with excessive production contributing to airway remodeling. Blocking IL-22 may reduce chronic structural changes associated with steroid-resistant asthma. Fezakinumab is a monoclonal antibody that targets IL-22, a cytokine involved in tissue homeostasis, repair, and inflammation. Early studies and trials were exploring its effectiveness in inflammatory diseases with IL-22 involvement, such as psoriasis and rheumatoid arthritis [\\n97\\n]. However, Fezakinumab has not been widely tested in asthma. Of interest, the Fezakinumab-response signature in atopic dermatitis identified severe neutrophilic asthmatic patients as potential responders to Fezakinumab therapy. Indeed, patients with severe neutrophilic asthma were proved to be potential responders for treatment with fezakinumab (anti-IL-22 mAb) [\\n97\\n]. Thus, Fezakinumab represents a promising approach to addressing an unmet need in steroid-resistant, non-eosinophilic asthma, though more research is clearly needed.\\nIL-1\\u03b2 Inhibitors\\nIL-1\\u03b2 signaling promotes the recruitment and activation of neutrophils in the airways, a hallmark of NEA. It has been shown that increased IL-1\\u03b2 in obese lungs not only increases pulmonary inflammation by leading to M1 polarization but also induces neutrophilia by promoting IL-17 production from ILC3s [\\n110\\n]. Since neutrophilic inflammation is less responsive to glucocorticoids, targeting IL-1\\u03b2 with canakinumab could help mitigate this inflammatory pathway. Canakinumab has primarily been studied and approved for diseases such as rheumatoid arthritis, systemic juvenile idiopathic arthritis, and certain autoinflammatory syndromes. While it has not been widely approved for asthma, there is a growing interest in exploring IL-1\\u03b2 blockade for NEA and SRA. Indeed, Canakinumab treatment has shown encourage results in a randomized double-blind clinical trial [\\n95\\n]. Especially, they evaluated the safety and tolerability of drug in mild allergic asthma patients and determined its anti-inflammatory effects on late asthmatic response after allergen inhalation. Anakinra, an IL-1 receptor antagonist, approved in the United States for the treatment of rheumatoid arthritis [\\n96\\n]. The results from anakinra clinical trials have illustrated that anakinra is a safe and well-tolerated therapy for patients with rheumatoid arthritis. Anakinra was also used in a phase I clinical study for asthma [\\n97\\n]. Especially, in a double-blind, placebo-controlled crossover study, a total of 17 healthy volunteers received 2 daily subcutaneous injections of 1 mg/kg anakinra followed by an inhaled lipopolysaccharide (LPS) challenge one hour after the second dose of anakinra treatment. As expected, anakinra effectively reduced airway neutrophilic inflammation, suggesting that anakinra is a potential therapeutic candidate for treatment of NEA. Intriguingly, anakinra successfully coped with SARS-Cov-2-induced cytokine storm and subsequent lung fibrosis [\\n111\\n]. Additionally, administration of anakinra during fungal-associated neutrophilic inflammation was showed to attenuate airway hyperreactivity and lowered Th1 and Th17 responses [\\n112\\n]. Thus, anakinra could be especially beneficial for asthmatic patients who exhibit poor response to standard therapies.\\nIL-23 Pathway Inhibition\\nIL-23 is crucial for the maintenance and expansion of IL-17-producing cells, including ILC3s and Th17 cells. Blocking this pathway could help in mitigating airway inflammation in steroid-resistant asthma. Unfortunately, treatment with rizankizumab, an anti-IL-23p19 antibody, was not beneficial for severe asthma and even worsen severe allergic asthma with annual asthma exacerbation rate ratio of 1.49 with risankizumab as compared with placebo [\\n91\\n,\\n113\\n]. In contrast, ustekinumab, a human monoclonal antibody approved for psoriasis, was developed to target the p40 subunit of IL-12 and IL-23. By blocking the IL-12 and IL-23, ustekinumab has been shown to inhibit the activation of pathogenic Th17 and Th1 responses [\\n114\\n,\\n115\\n]. Despite these encouraging data, there are no further progresses on the drug, at least in asthma.\\nHowever, some of these studies were either not powered [\\n92\\n\\u2013\\n94\\n] or showed no reduction in exacerbations [\\n31\\n]. Thus, more studies are clearly needed to explore the therapeutic potential of selectively targeting ILC3s. Especially, targeting novel pathways unique to ILC3s and modulating ILC3 function or differentiation might offer alternative therapeutic strategies and potentially improve control of inflammation in steroid-resistant conditions. This shift in focus might provide more effective treatment options for patients with non-eosinophilic asthma, particularly those with neutrophilic asthma, who currently face limited options in achieving adequate disease control.\\nSummary\\nIn this review, we examine the role of ILC3s in the pathogenesis of SRA, with a particular emphasis on NEA mechanisms. ILC3s have been identified as key contributors to severe asthma, driving neutrophilic inflammation and airway hyperresponsiveness. Recent studies suggest that ILC3s are promising therapeutic targets due to their roles in promoting inflammation, neutrophil recruitment, and glucocorticoid resistance. Given the limited effectiveness of standard treatments in SRA, novel therapeutic approaches targeting ILC3-related pathways could provide alternative options for patients with NEA. We focus on the involvement of ILC3s in mediating inflammatory responses through IL-17 and other pro-inflammatory mediators, which are crucial in SRA. Additionally, strategies to reduce GR-beta expression or enhance glucocorticoid efficacy through alternative pathways may further aid in managing steroid-resistant asthma with neutrophilic inflammation. However, the evidence linking ILC3s to steroid resistance remains limited due to the scarcity of studies on these cells. The objective of our review is to propose ILC3 as a potential therapeutic target for SRA, a significant treatment challenge, and to encourage further research to clarify the complex roles and mechanisms of ILC3s in asthma, as well as to explore the therapeutic potential of selectively modulating ILC3 activity.\",\n          \"Introduction\\nIndividuals are extensively exposed to sedentary behavior (SB), which is defined as any waking activity with an energy expenditure of less than 1.5 metabolic equivalent tasks, such as watching television, playing video games, using computers, sitting at school or work, and commuting while seated [\\n1\\n]. Recent trends indicate an increasing prevalence of SB, and a systematic review of 26 studies revealed an increase in sedentary lifestyles worldwide [\\n2\\n]. The prevalence of remaining seated for 8 or more hours increased significantly from 46.7%, in 2014, to 56.2%, in 2017, and 63%, in 2021 [\\n3\\n]. Increased SB represents a serious public health issue, [\\n4\\n] as sedentary lifestyles are associated with various adverse health outcomes, including increased all-cause and cardiovascular disease (CVD) mortality; [\\n5\\n] metabolic diseases, [\\n6\\n,\\n7\\n] such as diabetes mellitus (DM), hypertension (HTN), and dyslipidemia; inflammatory markers; [\\n8\\n] and cognitive impairment [\\n1\\n].\\nHealth research on SB should consider physical activity (PA), [\\n9\\n] as SB and PA are closely interrelated and are not mutually exclusive. For example, PA mitigates SB and prevents its persistence [\\n4\\n]. Recent studies have extensively explored the impacts of PA, particularly on CVD [\\n10\\n\\u2013\\n13\\n]. Although leisure-time PA (LTPA) or total PA has traditionally recognized benefits, the negative health effects of occupational PA (OPA) or household PA (HPA) indicate the phenomenon of the PA paradox [\\n14\\n].\\nFurthermore, in addition to physical health, the relationship between mental health and the SB and PA domains has been examined. Increased SB has a dose\\u2013response relationship with frequent depressive symptoms, [\\n15\\n] whereas replacing sedentary time at work with vigorous PA decreases the risk of depression [\\n16\\n]. Moreover, LTPA is associated with decreased incident rates of depression [\\n17\\n]. However, the association of PA domains, other than LTPA, with mental health remains unclear. In several studies, OPA was associated with improved mental health [\\n18\\n] whereas, conversely, two reviews reported associations of high OPA levels with increased depression and anxiety, [\\n19\\n,\\n20\\n] and a Japanese cohort study reported lower rates of depression in more active occupations, compared with those in sedentary occupations [\\n21\\n]. In addition, there is limited research on transportation-related PA (TRPA) or active commuting.\\nThe inconsistencies in the association of various domains of PA, except LTPA, with depression underscore the need for more evidence. Moreover, studies on the health effects of PA domains in different SB levels, particularly on their association with depression, are lacking [\\n19\\n]. Therefore, in this study, we aimed to investigate the relationship between the risk of depression and combinations of three PA domains (OPA, LTPA, and TRPA) with SB by using national data that represent the health status and physical activity levels of the Korean general population.\\nMethods\\nData description and participants\\nThis cross-sectional study, we used data from the 7\\nth\\nthrough 9\\nth\\nwaves (2016\\u20132022) of the Korea National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (KNHANES), which is implemented by the Korea Centers for Disease Control and Prevention to monitor the health and nutritional status of South Koreans and collect statistical data. Demographic and socioeconomic characteristics, such as age, sex, marital status, education level, monthly income, occupation, health behaviors, and personal or family medical history, are collected through interview-based surveys. KNHANES obtained approval from the Institutional Review Board of the Korea Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, and written informed consent was collected from all the participants. Ethical approval was not required for this analysis because this research entailed a secondary analysis of publicly accessible Korean national data without personal identifiers.\\nThe Patient Health Questionnaire-9 (PHQ-9), a standardized depression rating scale, has been administered every 2 years since 2014 [\\n22\\n]. Therefore, after excluding the outdated data from 2014, data from 2016, 2018, 2020, and 2022 were combined to enhance the statistical power. Among the 29,766 individuals surveyed over the 4 years, 21,873 had available PHQ-9 data (with 7,893 missing). After excluding 242 individuals with missing data on SB and 215 teenagers (age <20 years), the final analysis included 21,416 adults.\\nMeasurements\\nSB was assessed by asking the participants about their daily sitting or reclining hours, and was defined as \\u226510 hours of sitting or reclining per day, as determined by previous epidemiologic studies [\\n23\\n\\u2013\\n26\\n]. PA was evaluated using the Global Physical Activity Questionnaire (GPAQ), which is a component of the KNHANES. Originally developed by the World Health Organization (WHO), this self-administered instrument assesses OPA, LTPA, and TRPA [\\n27\\n]. The reliability and validity of the Korean version of the GPAQ have been verified [\\n28\\n]. In the GPAQ, \\u201cvigorous-intensity activity\\u201d refers to PA that involves rigorous physical exertion and a significant increase in breathing or heart rate, whereas \\u201cmoderate-intensity activity\\u201d refers to PA that involves moderate physical exertion and a modest increase in breathing or heart rate. The WHO guidelines recommend at least 150 or 75 min of moderate-intensity or vigorous-intensity activity, respectively, every week [\\n29\\n]. Individuals who met the quantitative criteria for moderate-to-vigorous PA (MVPA) at work or during leisure-time activities were classified as having OPA or LTPA, respectively [\\n29\\n]. TRPA was defined as involving at least 150 min per week of physical activities, such as walking or biking when traveling between locations, excluding work-related travel.\\nThe combination of each PA with SB generated four levels of joint association. For activities expected to reduce the risk, such as LTPA and TPA, the groups were categorized as those with: 1) low SB/high PA (reference group), 2) high SB/high PA, 3) low SB/low PA, and 4) high SB/low PA. Conversely, for activities that potentially increased the risk of depression, such as OPA, the groups were classified as: 1) low SB/low OPA (reference group), 2) high SB/low OPA, 3) low SB/high OPA, and 4) high SB/high OPA.\\nThe KNHANES VII\\u2013IX employed the PHQ-9 to assess depressive symptoms. This self-report tool is a reliable screening scale for identifying depressive symptoms. PHQ-9 rates nine items on a scale of 0 to 3 (not at all = 0, several days = 1, more than half of the days = 2, and nearly every day = 3), which indicate symptom frequency over the past 2 weeks, as aligned with the criteria of\\nDiagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders\\n,\\n4th edition\\n(DSM-IV) [\\n29\\n]. The cumulative score (0\\u201327) denotes symptom severity, with higher scores indicating greater severity [\\n30\\n]. A cutoff score of \\u226510 indicates the presence of depression, which potentially requires treatment, including medication [\\n31\\n,\\n32\\n]. This cutoff shows adequate sensitivity (88%) and specificity (88%) for identifying depression [\\n33\\n].\\nThis study encompassed various socioeconomic and health-related factors, including sex (men or women), age group (20s, 30s, 40s, 50s, 60 or older), marital status (married, divorced, single, widowed), obesity (BMI \\u226525 kg/m\\n2\\n), smoking status (current smoker, former/non-smoker), heavy alcohol consumption, income level, educational level (middle school or lower, high school, college or higher), occupation type (white-collar, pink-collar in sales or service, blue-collar), and presence of chronic disease (HTN, DM, dyslipidemia, and CVD), as diagnosed by a physician. Income level was classified into quartiles based on annual income, ranging from low to high. Heavy alcohol consumption was defined as the intake of \\u22657 and \\u22655 drinks, for men and women, respectively, on \\u22652 occasions per week in the past year.\\nStatistical analysis\\nThe association between depression risk and participants\\u2019 demographic and health characteristics was examined using the chi-square test. Multiple logistic regression analyses were performed to determine the odds ratios (ORs) and 95% confidence intervals (CIs) of the SB and PA domains in relation to the risk of depression. These analyses included the variables that were significantly associated with depression, including sex, age, marital status, obesity, smoking status, heavy drinking, income level, education level, and chronic diseases. Furthermore, to explore the joint associations of each PA\\u2013SB domain combination with the risk of depression, the ORs (95% CIs) were computed across the four groups. All the analyses were stratified by sex. All statistical analyses were performed using IBM SPSS Statistics for Windows ver. 27.0 (IBM Corp., Armonk, NY, USA). The statistical significance was set at\\np\\n< 0.05.\\nResults\\nTable 1\\nshows the results of the chi-square test for the association of the prevalence of depression with socioeconomic characteristics, SB, and PA domains for men and women. The increased prevalence of depression was significantly associated with being women; being divorced, single, widowed, obese, current smoker, heavy drinker; having lower education or income levels; and the presence of chronic disease. The prevalence of depression exhibited a U-shaped relationship with age and was the highest among pink-collar workers, followed by blue- and white-collar workers. Compared to their counterparts, individuals who were SB(+), OPA(+), and LTPA(\\u2013) had a significantly higher prevalence of depression (6.52% vs. 4.27%, 8.24% vs. 5%, and 5.55% vs. 3.2%, respectively). Although the prevalence was higher in TRPA(\\u2013) individuals (5.31% vs. 4.83%), this was not statistically significant. The overall results for all participants were similar when stratified by sex, except for the fact that, among men, no significant association with age was detected, and the prevalence of depression was higher among blue-collar workers than those in pink-collar workers.\\n10.1371/journal.pone.0312029.t001\\nTable 1\\nAssociation of demographics with depression in Korean adults (2016\\u20132022).\\nCharacteristics\\nPrevalence of Depression [N (%)]\\nTotal (N = 20673)\\nMen (N = 9397)\\nWomen (N = 12019)\\nSex\\n1109 (5.18)\\n344 (3.66)\\n765 (6.36)\\n**\\nAge, years\\n**\\nNS\\n**\\n20\\u201329\\n179 (7.03)\\n53 (4.48)\\n126 (9.25)\\n30\\u201339\\n182 (5.61)\\n62 (4.33)\\n120 (6.63)\\n40\\u201349\\n161 (4.16)\\n63 (3.84)\\n98 (4.4)\\n50\\u201359\\n154 (3.83)\\n46 (2.71)\\n108 (4.65)\\n\\u226560\\n433 (5.59)\\n120 (3.49)\\n313 (7.28)\\nMarital status\\n**\\n**\\n**\\nMarried\\n834 (4.73)\\n226 (3.06)\\n608 (5.93)\\nOther status\\n275 (7.28)\\n118 (5.87)\\n157 (8.87)\\nBody mass index, kg/m\\n2\\n**\\n**\\n**\\n<25\\n1002 (4.98)\\n311 (3.54)\\n691 (6.09)\\n\\u226525\\n107 (8.26)\\n33 (5.35)\\n74 (10.91)\\nSmoking status\\n**\\n**\\n**\\nNonsmoker or ex-smoker\\n816 (4.61)\\n180 (2.84)\\n636 (5.6)\\nCurrent smoker\\n290 (7.88)\\n164 (5.38)\\n126 (19.97)\\nHeavy drinking\\n**\\n**\\n**\\nNo\\n937 (4.96)\\n248 (3.29)\\n689 (6.06)\\nYes\\n169 (6.83)\\n96 (5.21)\\n73 (11.55)\\nEducation level\\n**\\n**\\n**\\nMiddle school or lower\\n6044 (7.51)\\n107 (5.03)\\n347 (8.86)\\nHigh school\\n352 (4.99)\\n120 (3.66)\\n232 (6.15)\\nCollege or higher\\n302 (3.63)\\n116 (2.91)\\n186 (4.3)\\nIncome level\\n**\\n**\\n**\\nLow\\n452 (8.7)\\n166 (7.24)\\n286 (9.86)\\nMedium-low\\n296 (5.51)\\n77 (3.29)\\n219 (7.23)\\nMedium-high\\n205 (3.82)\\n51 (2.16)\\n154 (5.12)\\nHigh\\n155 (2.85)\\n50 (2.1)\\n105 (3.44)\\nOccupation\\n**\\n**\\n**\\nWhite collar\\n300 (3.87)\\n95 (2.85)\\n205 (4.65)\\nPink collar\\n309 (6.99)\\n56 (4.08)\\n253 (8.3)\\nBlue collar\\n364 (5.58)\\n151 (4.31)\\n213 (7.05)\\nChronic disease\\na\\n**\\n**\\n**\\nNo\\n638 (4.51)\\n201 (3.32)\\n437 (5.4)\\nYes\\n471 (6.48)\\n143 (4.28)\\n328 (8.35)\\nSB\\nb\\n**\\n**\\n**\\nNo\\n544 (4.27)\\n162 (2.93)\\n382 (5.29)\\nYes\\n565 (6.52)\\n182 (4.7)\\n383 (7.98)\\nOPA\\nc\\n**\\n**\\n**\\nNo\\n1011 (5)\\n306 (3.51)\\n705 (6.13)\\nYes\\n98 (8.24)\\n38 (5.6)\\n60 (11.76)\\nLTPA\\nd\\n**\\n**\\n**\\nNo\\n1001 (5.55)\\n303 (4.04)\\n698 (6.62)\\nYes\\n108 (3.2)\\n41 (2.17)\\n67 (4.52)\\nTRPA\\ne\\nNS\\nNS\\nNS\\nNo\\n828 (5.31)\\n252 (3.65)\\n576 (6.62)\\nYes\\n281 (4.83)\\n92 (3.68)\\n189 (5.69)\\nSB = sedentary behavior, PA = physical activity, OPA = occupational physical activity, LTPA = leisure-time physical activity, TRPA = transportation-related physical activity.\\n*\\np\\n<0.05 and\\n**\\np\\n<0.01, from chi-square tests, between the prevalence of depression and characteristics.\\na\\nHaving any chronic diseases, including hypertension, diabetes, dyslipidemia, and cardiovascular disease, diagnosed by a physician.\\nb\\nSitting time \\u226510 h/day.\\nc\\nUndertaking \\u2265150 or \\u226575 minutes of moderate or vigorous PA, respectively, per week at work.\\nd\\nUndertaking \\u2265150 or \\u226575 minutes of moderate or vigorous PA, respectively, per week during leisure-time.\\ne\\nUndertaking \\u2265150 minutes of PA per week during transportation.\\nTable 2\\npresents the adjusted ORs [95% CI] for the association of the combination of SB and different types of PA with the risk of depression.

Unlike previous research that focused on the relationship between either PA or SB alone and depression, this study uniquely explores the joint association of specific PA types and SB with depression. The findings suggest that, depending on the PA domains, various SB\\u2013PA combinations can have different impacts on mental health.\\nThe main findings of this study are twofold. First, in men and women, SB and OPA were significantly associated with an increased risk of depression. LTPA was significantly associated with a reduced risk of depression only in men, whereas LTPA and TRPA were associated with a reduced risk of depression in women. Second, the analysis of each PA domain\\u2013SB combination revealed that, in men and women, compared with the SB(\\u2013)/OPA(\\u2013) reference group, the SB(+)/OPA(+) group had the highest risk of depression. Despite sex-specific differences, compared with the SB(\\u2013)/LTPA(+) reference group, the SB(+)/LTPA(\\u2013) group had a significantly higher risk of depression, and the same trend was observed for the SB(\\u2013)/TRPA(+) group. This finding is meaningful as it indicates that LTPA (in women) and TRPA (in men and women), which were not individually associated with the risk of depression, were significantly associated with this risk when simultaneously exposed to SB(+); this suggests a synergistic effect of these factors on the risk of depression. Furthermore, in women, the SB(+)/LTPA(+) group showed the highest increase in the risk of depression (OR = 2.15), which indicates SB\\u2019s stronger association with the risk of depression as compared with that of LTPA. Likewise, in men, the SB(+)/TRPA(+) group had the highest increase in the risk of depression (OR = 2.13), indicating SB\\u2019s dominant association, compared to that of TRPA, with the risk of depression.\\nLTPA and SB were significantly associated with depression in previous systematic reviews and meta-analyses of prospective studies [\\n34\\n\\u2013\\n36\\n]. SB has been consistently associated with increased prevalence and incidence rates of depression across domains, whereas LTPA protects against the risk of depression. Plausible explanations for this primarily revolve around traditional LTPA, namely exercise, which offers psychological benefits, such as distraction from negative thoughts, and improved physical self-perceptions and self-efficacy. Additionally, social benefits, such as social support and participation, contribute to social reinforcement, whereas the physiological benefits include increased endorphin levels and neurotransmitter availability [\\n21\\n,\\n35\\n,\\n37\\n].\\nProlonged SB may elevate the risk of depression by displacing time spent on PA, which can alleviate depressive symptoms [\\n36\\n]. Particularly, excessive television watching and use of personal computers and smartphones can increase the risk of depression by disrupting direct interpersonal communication and social interaction, in what is known as the social displacement hypothesis [\\n38\\n]. Korea is a global leader in smartphone and internet usage, with widespread access in workplaces and daily life [\\n3\\n]. Reducing the use of smart or mobile devices can reduce SB, and thereby influence PA and its contribution to depression, especially in Korea.\\nThe association of OPA with an increased risk of depression in this study aligns with the results of previous research. A recent meta-analysis indicated a positive association between OPA and ill mental health, [\\n10\\n] and a study using KNHANES data reported that OPA was not as beneficial as LTPA and significantly increased depressive symptoms [\\n39\\n]. OPA differs fundamentally from LTPA regarding motivation, locus of control, and enjoyment. Regarding LTPA, motivation refers to weight control, fitness, and mood improvement; locus of control refers to autonomy in choosing the type, intensity, location, and timing of PA; and enjoyment is a key factor in the positive psychological outcomes of exercise. Although these aspects play a crucial role in the antidepressant effects of LTPA, they are not shared by OPA. Instead, intrinsic motivation for OPA is usually driven by financial gain, and OPA is associated with lower levels of control and autonomy [\\n40\\n]. Finally, despite its potential contribution to overall PA levels, high OPA was associated with minority ethnic groups and lower socioeconomic status, [\\n41\\n] which are associated with an increased risk of depression [\\n42\\n].\\nThe association of TRPA with depression was only marginally significant in women and, when combined with SB, weakened further. Previous research on the relationship between TRPA and depressive symptoms has predominantly yielded null findings [\\n21\\n,\\n43\\n]. Moreover, a more recent systematic review reported inconclusive results, with active commuting having beneficial effects on depressive symptoms in only 2 of 7 studies [\\n44\\n]. Theoretically, TRPA, such as active commuting, can reduce depression risk by contributing to an increase in daily PA levels and serve as a valuable source of PA for several workers with limited time for exercise outside of commuting. Research is warranted to further explore this relationship, and future studies should conduct more detailed analyses of the types, frequency, and volume of TRPA.\\nThe focus of this study was to analyze the previously unexplored association of the combination of SB and each PA domain with depression, and this enhances the significance of this study. Individuals can be both physically active and highly sedentary, as these are not mutually exclusive [\\n45\\n]. Particularly, the increased risk of depression was prominent when individuals were exposed to both OPA and SB, and this suggests that OPA may not necessarily have the same positive effects as exercise [\\n46\\n]. For example, blue-collar workers involved in OPA during work hours may also exhibit SB at home, whereas pink- or white-collar workers, who are predominantly engaged in SB at work, may perform OPA as part of their job duties, and potentially increases the risk of depression owing to the simultaneous exposure to OPA and SB. The prevalence of OPA(+) individuals varied across the occupational groups, with the highest proportion observed among blue-collar workers (5.38%). However, some level of OPA was observed even in the occupations characterized by prolonged SB (white-collar workers, 5.02%; pink-collar workers, 4.25%). Therefore, as preventive measures against depression, MVPA should be reduced at work or substituted with lighter PA and lower SB.\\nThe increased risk of depression in the LTPA(\\u2013)/SB(+) group in this study supports previous findings of the combined association of SB and overall PA with the risk of depression [\\n34\\n,\\n47\\n]. The lack of domain-specific SB measurement could be a reason for the nonsignificant association of SB at different PA levels and the risk of depression in a study conducted in Japan [\\n37\\n]. Detailed information about situations where SB occurs, such as workplaces or homes, may facilitate a better understanding of the temporal relationships between PA and SB. Particularly in Korea, where the percentage of SB has been increasing annually, future national surveys should include assessments of SB in different domains to facilitate its utilization in research.\\nLimitations\\nThis study has some limitations. First, owing to the nature of mental health conditions, this study\\u2019s reliance on data from cross-sectional surveys may have resulted in a cyclical and reciprocal association between increased SB and decreased PA with regard to the risk of depression. Second, sitting time was assessed with a single question, which raises issues regarding validation. Moreover, the SB domain was not specifically investigated, which limits the application and interpretation of the results. Future research should explore the SB domains in detail. Finally, the use of data from 2016 to 2022 may have introduced variations in the rates of depression and PA across the years. Although the difference was expected, particularly with the onset of the coronavirus disease pandemic in 2020, additional analyses that incorporate the survey year as a covariate did not significantly alter the significance or trends of the results.\\nConclusion\\nSB and OPA contribute to the risk of depression, whereas LTPA exhibits a protective effect. However, a protective effect of TRPA on depressive symptoms was not observed. Encouraging PA during leisure time, avoiding excessive PA at work, and reducing SB may help reduce depressive symptoms. Future research should clarify the specific domains of SB and the detailed aspects of TRPA in relation to the risk of depression.\",\n          \"Introduction\\nThe emergence of the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) virus led to the onset of the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic, which has posed a worldwide crisis since its beginning in 2019\\n1\\n. The severity of COVID-19 can vary from mild symptoms to severe illness in a small proportion of patients. Factors such as smoking, advanced age, sex, and comorbidities such as hypertension, diabetes, or obesity have been linked to increased morbidity and mortality associated with the disease\\n2\\n. To date, the worldwide number of confirmed COVID-19 cases caused by SARS-CoV-2 has reached 695,750,008, with 6,919,476 deaths (COVID - Coronavirus Statistics - Worldometer (worldometers.info)\\n3\\n.\\nAs it is well-established, RNA viruses have a tendency to undergo rapid evolution and adaptation to their host environments, which can result in the emergence of new viral variants\\n4\\n,\\n5\\n. Since its identification, SARS-CoV-2 has spread rapidly and acquired new mutations, resulting in the identification of many variants with increased transmissibility, severity, and immune evasion\\n6\\n. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) and World Health Organisation (WHO) guidelines, characterized SARS-CoV-2 variants into two categories: variants of interests (VOIs) and variants of concern (VOCs). VOIs have mutations that may lead to changes in the virus phenotype, with documented community transmission or international spread. Eta (B.1.525) and Iota (B.1.526) identified in the USA, Lambda (C.37) detected in Peru and Kappa (B.1.617.1) originated in India are some examples of VOIs. On the other hand, VOCs include variants with mutations that cause increased viral transmission rates and/or reduced efficacy of vaccination, having a harmful effect on human health. Alpha (B.1.1.7), initially identified in the United Kingdom, Beta (B.1.351) in South Africa, Gamma (P.1) in Brazil/Japan, and Delta (B.1.617.2) in India are a few instances of Variants of Concern (VOCs)\\n7\\n\\u2013\\n9\\n.\\nIn November 2021, the World Health Organization designated Omicron (B.1.1.529) a VOC due to its recent emergence as well as rapid spread\\n10\\n,\\n11\\n. Afterwards, various sub-lineages of the Omicron variant were identified, such as BA.1, BA.2, BA.2.12.1, BA.2.75, BA.4, and BA.5, BQ.1.1 (a sublineage of BA.5) and XBB.1.5 (a recombinant of two sublineages of Omicron) each with distinct features of transmissibility and ability to elude the immune system\\n12\\n\\u2013\\n15\\n. The Omicron variant is one of the most infectious, highly modified, and crucial VOC that poses a serious and immediate threat to public health. The Omicron variant carries numerous mutations, including both previously identified and novel ones, that elevate the likelihood of infection and potentially diminish the effectiveness of current vaccines\\n16\\n.\\nThe S gene has been found to have a high frequency of mutations\\n17\\n, particularly in the receptor-binding domain (RBD) and N-terminal domain (NTD)\\n18\\n. The B.1.1.529 variant exhibits a concerning number of substitutions on the spike protein, including 15 located solely on the RNA-binding domain (RBD), which could potentially increase its affinity to the human Angiotensin-Converting Enzyme 2 (ACE2) receptor\\n19\\n,\\n20\\n. This is believed to be due to selective pressure for substitutions that enhance viral fitness, such as altering the spike protein\\u2019s structure to improve binding to the host receptor or evade recognition by antibodies\\n18\\n,\\n19\\n. In general, a vaccine offers dual immune protection by generating neutralizing antibodies (NAbs) through B cells. The majority of research has been directed towards studying the neutralizing antibodies targeting the spike protein\\n21\\n\\u2013\\n24\\n. While, deciphering the impact of these mutations on the cellular T cell immune response is a challenging task, SARS-CoV-2-specific T cells play a important role in clearing the virus by eliminating infected cells, thereby reducing viral replication and potentially mitigating pathogenicity\\n25\\n\\u2013\\n29\\n. Several studies have reported that mutations within the spike protein of SARS-CoV-2 have been linked to the evasion of antiviral T-cell immunity by VOCs. Studies have suggested that the substitutions in numerous HLA-I-restricted SARS-CoV-2 epitopes could potentially weaken the binding of specific T-cell receptors, leading to the escape of VOCs from CTL clearance by CD8\\u2009+\\u2009T lymphocytes\\n30\\n\\u2013\\n33\\n. Increasing evidence suggests that SARS-CoV-2 variants, such as Alpha, Beta, Delta, and Omicron, have the potential to evade T-cell immune responses and viral clearance, which raises concerns about the effectiveness of vaccines and previous infections in providing protection against these variants\\n32\\n,\\n34\\n\\u2013\\n37\\n.Therefore, the development of a new vaccine that can overcome the mutations in the virus genome is essential to combat emerging SARS-CoV-2 variants.\\nThe aim of this study was to explore the potency of T cell immune responses against Omicron VOCs by utilizing knowledge about T cell epitopes that are typically targeted in individuals who have been infected with or vaccinated against COVID-19. A comparative in-silico analysis was conducted to examine how mutant epitopes of Omicron and its sub-variants affect the immunodominant epitopes of the ancestral SARS-CoV-2 strain, with the aim of understanding how these mutations can lead to immune evasion of cellular T cell immunity. This study focuses on alterations in the predicted binding affinity of epitopes to their corresponding HLA restriction elements, as well as the probability of CD8\\u2009+\\u2009and CD4\\u2009+\\u2009T cell receptors cross-recognizing epitopes between the reference SARS-CoV-2 strain and the concerned variants. Conversely, we also identify T cell cross-reactive CD8\\u2009+\\u2009and CD4\\u2009+\\u2009epitopes from the wild-type SARS-CoV-2 that remain conserved across Omicron sub-variants. The goal behind this identification is to discover potential vaccine candidate epitopes for developing an effective multi-epitope vaccine aimed at protecting against circulating SARS-CoV-2 variants, particularly the Omicron VOC.\\nUnderstanding T cell immune escape is a critical and continuously developing field of research with significant implications for public health, as well as the design of novel therapies and vaccines. This knowledge is crucial for developing effective vaccines, assessing the immunogenicity of vaccine candidates, and monitoring mutational occurrences and epitope escape as the virus circulates in human populations. Comprehending the mechanisms underlying T cell immune evasion by SARS-CoV-2 variants is overall vital for controlling the pandemic situation.\\nResults\\nMinimal mutations are found in CD8\\u2009+\\u2009and CD4\\u2009+\\u2009specific dominant epitopes\\nIn order to locate and calculate the percentage identity, we aligned the dominant epitopes of SARS-CoV-2 to the variant sequences including BA.1, BA.2, BA.2.12.1, BA.2.75, BA.5, BQ.1.1 and XBB.1.5. Our analysis was limited to epitopes derived from the spike protein of SARS-CoV-2. This protein included 143 and 139 identified CD8\\u2009+\\u2009and CD4\\u2009+\\u2009T cell recognized epitopes. The number of SARS-CoV-2 T cell epitopes with and without mutations is depicted in Fig.\\n1\\na,b for the seven variants of omicron including the omicron recombinant.\\nFig. 1\\nAnalysis of spike specific SARS-CoV2 T cell epitopes. Number of spike specific SARS-CoV2 T cell epitopes with and without mutations present in the seven variants. (\\na\\n) CD8\\u2009+\\u2009T cell epitopes (\\nb\\n) CD4\\u2009+\\u2009T cell epitopes.\\nWe discovered that a significant portion of the dominant CD8\\u2009+\\u2009and CD4\\u2009+\\u2009T cell epitopes of SARS-CoV-2 remain conserved within the omicron VOCs. Among the 143 dominant CD8\\u2009+\\u2009epitopes from the SARS-CoV-2 (Wuhan_Hu_1 strain), only a small percentage contain variant-related mutations in the sequences of different variants. Specifically, 17% of BA.1, 14% of BA.2, 16% of BA.2.12.1, BQ.1.1, and XBB.1.5, along with 15% of BA.2.75 and BA.5 CD8\\u2009+\\u2009T cell epitopes, have mutations present at least once within the variant sequences. Similarly, in the analysis of CD4\\u2009+\\u2009epitopes for the seven different Omicron variants, we found that VOC mutations were present in 29% of BA.1, BA.2.12.1, BA.2.75, 26% of BA.2, 30% of BA.5, and 32% and 33% of BQ.1.1, XBB.1.5, respectively. A limited number of mutations were observed in the CD8+ (CTL) and CD4+ (Th) specific dominant epitopes of the omicron variants. In a broader context, concerning CD4\\u2009+\\u2009epitopes, the XBB.1.5 variant exhibited relatively reduced conservation, approximately at 67%. In contrast, within the BA.1 variant, about 83% of CD8\\u2009+\\u2009epitopes displayed decreased conservation due to a notably higher quantity of mutations identified in their spike protein.\\nChanges in amino acids within T cell immunodominant epitopes can lead to modifications in the binding affinity with their corresponding HLA restriction elements. As a consequence, the epitope\\u2019s presentation on the surface of cells infected by SARS-CoV-2 could be modified, rendering it less detectable by T cell recognition. To examine how these variations might affect HLA binding profiles of epitopes, we compared the binding capability of dominant and mutated peptides using NetMHCpan-4.1 and NetMHCpanII-4.0 tools for MHC class I and II alleles respectively.\\nDue to the limitations of the tools used, not all dominant epitopes had their binding affinity predicted. Therefore, we only included those dominant epitopes that were projected to bind to one or more HLA alleles of class I and II. The overview of SARS-CoV-2 T cell specific dominant epitopes affected by mutations in the variants of concern is shown in Table\\n1\\n. Overall 28 CD8\\u2009+\\u2009and 44 CD4\\u2009+\\u2009specific dominant epitopes were identified to be mutated across all omicron variants. Figure\\n2\\na,b display an alluvial diagram illustrating a compilation of mutated epitopes found in CD8\\u2009+\\u2009and CD4\\u2009+\\u2009cells, along with associated mutations and the VOCs. It is noteworthy that certain epitopes consistently exhibited mutations across multiple variants, whereas others were unique to specific variants. Notably, the seven dominant CD8\\u2009+\\u2009epitopes, namely KIADYNYKL, FQPTNGVGY, GYQPYRVVVLSF, YQDVNCTEV, IGAEHVNNSY, SPRRARSVA, and KQIYKTPPIKDF, exhibited mutations in all variants examined. In the case of the prominent CD4\\u2009+\\u2009epitope, FKIYSKHTPINLVRD, it underwent mutations specific to each variant: FKIYSKHTPIIVREP in BA.1, FKIYSKHTPINLGRD in BA.2, BA.2.12.1, and BA.5, FKIYSKHTPVNLGRD in BA.2.75, and FKIYSKHTPINLERD in BA.5. In addition to these findings, we observed that a limited number of dominant epitopes in CD4\\u2009+\\u2009and CD8\\u2009+\\u2009cells underwent either identical or distinct mutations in at most two different variants.\\nFig. 2\\nInvestigation of mutated dominant epitopes and associated variants of concern (VOCs). CD8+ (\\na\\n) and (\\nb\\n) CD4\\u2009+\\u2009T cell epitopes with variant specific mutations in the spike protein from omicron VoCs are shown. The figure illustrates how these mutations affect the dominant CD8\\u2009+\\u2009and CD4\\u2009+\\u2009T cell epitopes, with connecting lines representing mutations that occurred between variants. Distinct colors are used to highlight the immunodominant epitopes that have undergone mutations among all the variants. The alluvial plots were generated by using RAWGraphs.\\nHLA restrictions of dominant and mutant CD8\\u2009+\\u2009and CD4\\u2009+\\u2009T cell epitopes\\nIn order to ensure that mutant epitopes do not evade CD8\\u2009+\\u2009and CD4\\u2009+\\u2009T cell recognition by failing to bind to the HLA-I and II molecules of antigen presenting cells, which is an essential step in initiating T-cell responses and required for T-dependent B-cell activation, we investigated the differences in HLA allele binding between mutant and the dominant T-cell epitopes found on the spike proteins of variants, in accordance with the study of Sankaranarayanan et al. 2022\\n38\\n. This analysis involved the utilization of NetMHCpan 4.1 and NetMHCIIpan 4.0, as CD8\\u2009+\\u2009and CD4\\u2009+\\u2009T-cell responses are influenced by HLA-I and HLA-II restrictions, respectively. A 2% threshold was employed to designate MHC-I alleles as binders, encompassing both strong and weak binding interactions. On the other hand, a 5% cut-off threshold was utilized for MHC-II alleles to distinguish between binders and non-binders. Figure\\n3\\na,b illustrate the pattern of HLA-I and HLA-II allele restrictions for mutated CD8\\u2009+\\u2009and CD4\\u2009+\\u2009epitopes, respectively. The Supplementary file1 contains a comprehensive analysis of comparative HLA-I and II allele restriction patterns for both dominant and mutated CD8\\u2009+\\u2009and CD4\\u2009+\\u2009epitopes, illustrated in Supplementary Fig.\\nS1\\na and 1b, respectively. Tables\\n1\\nand\\n2\\npresents the counts of HLA-I and II alleles to which dominant and mutated epitopes bind, respectively. The EL rank scores, for both dominant and mutated epitopes of the variant can be found in the Supplementary Table\\nS1\\nand\\nS2\\n, containing the raw data. Among 52 pairs of CD8\\u2009+\\u2009dominant-mutated epitope pairs, 21 mutated epitopes maintained the same HLA restriction as their dominant counterparts, indicating a 100% HLA restriction retention. A total of 35 mutated epitopes, approximately 67%, retained over 50% of their HLA restriction. Moreover, 3 mutated epitopes only preserved 20\\u201340% of the HLA restriction observed in the dominant epitopes. Notably, out of the 14 mutated epitopes, that did not exhibit binding, three of them (FRPTYGVGH, GHQPYRVVVLSF, and SHRRARSVA) lost their capability to bind with HLA-I alleles. This loss of binding can be attributed to shared mutations across all variants of concern, namely Q498R, N501Y, Y505H in FQPTNGVGY, Y505H in GYQPYRVVVLSF, and P681H in SPRRARSVA. Additionally, data revealed that 5 overlapping immuno-dominant epitopes were only effected in BA.1, and XBB.1.5 variants due to common mutations namely G142D and Del144.\\nTable 1\\nComparison of HLA allele restrictions patterns in dominant and mutant CD4\\u2009+\\u2009T cell epitopes.\\nDominant wild-type Epitopes\\nOmicron specific CD8\\u2009+\\u2009peptides\\nOmicron VOCs\\nNo. of alleles that bind the dominant wild-type epitope (D)\\nNo. of alleles that bind mutant epitopes (M)\\nNo. of common alleles (Y)\\n% of HLA restriction retained for mutant epitopes (Y/D*100)\\nLPPAYTNSF\\nRTQSYTNSF\\nBA.2,BA.2.12.1,BA.2.75,BA.5,BQ.1.1,XBB.1.5\\n5\\n11\\n1\\n20\\nVTWFHAIHV\\nVTWFHVISG\\nBA.1\\n4\\n0\\n0\\n0\\nVTWFHAISG\\nBA.5,BQ.1.1\\n4\\n0\\n0\\n0\\nRFDNPVLPF\\nRFDNPALPF\\nXBB.1.5\\n5\\n5\\n5\\n100\\nGVYFASTEK\\nGVYFASIEK\\nBA.1\\n4\\n4\\n4\\n100\\nTEKSNIIRGW\\nIEKSNIIRGW\\nBA.1\\n2\\n2\\n2\\n100\\nFCNDPFLGVY\\nFCNDPFLDHK\\nBA.1\\n5\\n0\\n0\\n0\\nFCNDPFLDVY\\nBA.2,BA.2.12.1,BA.2.75,BA.5,BQ.1.1\\n5\\n3\\n3\\n60\\nFCNDPFLDVY\\nXBB.1.5\\n5\\n3\\n3\\n60\\nFCNDPFLGVYY\\nFCNDPFLDHKN\\nBA.1\\n3\\n0\\n0\\n0\\nFCNDPFLDVYY\\nBA.2,BA.2.12.1,BA.2.75,BA.5,BQ.1.1\\n3\\n2\\n2\\n66.666667\\nFCNDPFLDVYQ\\nXBB.1.5\\n3\\n0\\n0\\n0\\nCNDPFLGVY\\nCNDPFLDHK\\nBA.1\\n2\\n0\\n0\\n0\\nCNDPFLDVY\\nBA.2,BA.2.12.1,BA.2.75,BA.5,BQ.1.1\\n2\\n1\\n1\\n50\\nCNDPFLDVY\\nXBB.1.5\\n2\\n1\\n1\\n50\\nCNDPFLGVYY\\nCNDPFLDHKN\\nBA.1\\n1\\n0\\n0\\n0\\nCNDPFLDVYY\\nBA.2,BA.2.12.1,BA.2.75,BA.5,BQ.1.1\\n1\\n1\\n1\\n100\\nCNDPFLDVYQ\\nXBB.1.5\\n1\\n0\\n0\\n0\\nGVYYHKNNK\\nPFLDHKNNK\\nBA.1\\n5\\n0\\n0\\n0\\nDVYYHKNNK\\nBA.2,BA.2.12.1,BA.5,BQ.1.1\\n5\\n3\\n2\\n40\\nDVYYHENNK\\nBA.2.75\\n5\\n2\\n1\\n20\\nDVYQKNNKS\\nXBB.1.5\\n5\\n0\\n0\\n0\\nKSWMESEFRVY\\nKSRMESELRVY\\nBA.2.75\\n6\\n5\\n5\\n83.333333\\nIYSKHTPINL\\nIYSKHTPIIV\\nBA.1\\n2\\n1\\n1\\n50\\nIYSKHTPVNL\\nBA.2.75\\n2\\n2\\n2\\n100\\nTPINLVRDL\\nTPIIVREPE\\nBA.1\\n5\\n0\\n0\\n0\\nTPINLGRDL\\nBA.2,BA.2.12.1,BA.5,BQ.1.1\\n5\\n4\\n4\\n80\\nTPVNLGRDL\\nBA.2.75\\n5\\n4\\n4\\n80\\nTPINLERDL\\nXBB.1.5\\n5\\n4\\n4\\n80\\nCVADYSVLY\\nCVADYSVIY\\nXBB.1.5\\n10\\n8\\n8\\n80\\nNSASFSTFK\\nNLAPFFTFK\\nBA.1\\n4\\n6\\n4\\n100\\nNFAPFFAFK\\nBA.2,BA.2.12.1,BA.2.75,BA.5,BQ.1.1,XBB.1.5\\n4\\n6\\n4\\n100\\nKIADYNYKL\\nNIADYNYKL\\nBA.1,BA.2,BA.2.12.1,BA.2.75,BA.5,BQ.1.1,XBB.1.5\\n6\\n5\\n4\\n66.666667\\nNLDSKVGGNY\\nKLDSKVSGNY\\nBA.1,BA.2.75\\n2\\n4\\n2\\n100\\nKLDSKVGGNY\\nBA.2,BA.2.12.1,BA.5\\n2\\n4\\n2\\n100\\nKLDSTVGGNY\\nBQ.1.1\\n2\\n4\\n2\\n100\\nKLDSKPSGNY\\nXBB.1.5\\n2\\n4\\n2\\n100\\nNYNYLYRLF\\nNYNYQYRLF\\nBA.2.12.1\\n2\\n2\\n2\\n100\\nNYNYRYRLF\\nBA.5,BQ.1.1\\n2\\n2\\n2\\n100\\nRLFRKSNLK\\nRLFRKSKLK\\nBA.2.75,BQ.1.1,XBB.1.5\\n4\\n4\\n4\\n100\\nYFPLQSYGF\\nYFPLRSYSF\\nBA.1\\n2\\n4\\n2\\n100\\nYFPLRSYGF\\nBA.2,BA.2.12.1\\n2\\n3\\n2\\n100\\nYSPLQSYGF\\nXBB.1.5\\n2\\n3\\n2\\n100\\nYGFQPTNGV\\nYSFRPTYGV\\nBA.1\\n4\\n7\\n4\\n100\\nYGFRPTYGV\\nBA.2,BA.2.12.1,BA.2.75,BA.5,BQ.1.1,XBB.1.5\\n4\\n3\\n3\\n75\\nFQPTNGVGY\\nFRPTYGVGH\\nBA.1,BA.2,BA.2.12.1,BA.2.75,BA.5,BQ.1.1,XBB.1.5\\n5\\n0\\n0\\n0\\nGYQPYRVVVLSF\\nGHQPYRVVVLSF\\nBA.1,BA.2,BA.2.12.1,BA.2.75,BA.5,BQ.1.1,XBB.1.5\\n2\\n0\\n0\\n0\\nYQDVNCTEV\\nYQGVNCTEV\\nBA.1,BA.2,BA.2.12.1,BA.2.75,BA.5,BQ.1.1,XBB.1.5\\n4\\n3\\n3\\n75\\nIGAEHVNNSY\\nIGAEYVNNSY\\nBA.1,BA.2,BA.2.12.1,BA.2.75,BA.5,BQ.1.1,XBB.1.5\\n4\\n4\\n4\\n100\\nSPRRARSVA\\nSHRRARSVA\\nBA.1,BA.2,BA.2.12.1,BA.2.75,BA.5,BQ.1.1,XBB.1.5\\n2\\n0\\n0\\n0\\nKQIYKTPPIKDF\\nKQIYKTPPIKYF\\nBA.1,BA.2,BA.2.12.1,BA.2.75,BA.5,BQ.1.1,XBB.1.5\\n1\\n4\\n1\\n100\\nVLNDILSRL\\nVLNDIFSRL\\nBA.1\\n6\\n9\\n6\\n100\\nFig. 3\\nThe HLA-I and II allele restriction patterns of mutated CD8 (\\na\\n) and CD4 (\\nb\\n) epitopes from the spike protein of all VOCs were investigated.

depicted in Table\\n2\\n, it is evident that out of 91 CD4\\u2009+\\u2009dominant-mutated epitope pairs, 63 (~\\u200969%) display more than 50% similarity in HLA restriction compared to their corresponding dominant epitopes. Additionally, the data revealed significant variability in the HLA restriction for certain epitopes, with seven epitopes showing no shared HLA allele between the restriction sets of dominant and mutated epitopes. Notably, seven mutated epitopes, namely SNVTWFHVISGTNGT, LAPFFTFKCYGVSPT, ISSVLNDIFSRLDKV from the BA.1 variant, SVIYNFAPFFAFKCY from XBB.1.5, YADSFVIRGNEVSQI, VIRGNEVSQIAPGQT from all variants except BA.1, and STEIYQAGNKPCNGV from all variants, exhibit diverse HLA-II binding patterns. Interestingly, among the eleven mutated epitopes, which include five from BA.1, one from BA.2.75, one from each of BA.2, BA.2.12.1, BA.5, and BQ.1.1, two from BA.2, BA.2.12.1, BA.2.75, BA.5, BQ.1.1 as well as two from each of the studied VOCs, none demonstrated binding to any of the HLA-II alleles examined in the study. Furthermore, many CD8\\u2009+\\u2009and CD4\\u2009+\\u2009mutated epitopes are anticipated to bind to additional alleles compared to their respective dominant epitopes, as indicated in Tables\\n1\\nand\\n2\\n. As indicated by the binding of mutated epitopes to either similar alleles or different alleles as their native counterparts, these epitopes have the ability to be recognized by CD8\\u2009+\\u2009and CD4\\u2009+\\u2009cells despite their mutations. The supplementary Table\\nS3\\nprovides the overview of dominant T cell epitopes in SARS-CoV-2 affected by mutations.\\nBased on our analysis of the omicron variants, we find that a substantial proportion of the mutated epitopes display a level of resemblance in HLA-I (~\\u200967%) and HLA-II (~\\u200969%) restrictions when compared to their respective dominant epitopes, as predicted by our HLA-I and II binding analysis. This suggests that these variants are unlikely to evade the CD8\\u2009+\\u2009and CD4\\u2009+\\u2009T-cell responses triggered by the existing mRNA (messenger RNA) spike protein vaccines.\\nMolecular docking and simulation study of dominant-mutant epitope pairs with MHC-I alleles\\nTo validate the binding of mutant epitopes with the Class-I alleles, peptide docking of the selected binders was performed against five globally prevalent MHC-I alleles present in humans, and the obtained docking score was compared with the score of the equivalent dominant-allele complex\\n39\\n. The difference in binding affinity between the dominant-mutant epitope pair varied with the Class-I allele in question (Table\\n3\\n). For instance, the docking score was observed to be improved for all the mutant epitopes against the most frequently found Class-I allele, HLA-A*02:01 suggesting augmentation in binding affinity. For HLA-A*01:01, 53.33% of the binders showed reduced binding affinity than their dominant epitopes, while 46.67% revealed almost equal or slightly enhanced binding affinity. In the case of HLA-A*03:01, 50% of the binders showed better binding affinity than their dominant equivalents, whereas 50% showed a reduction in binding affinity. Further, for HLA-A*24:02, 40% of the binders viz. RTQSYTNSF, YFPLRSYSF, YSPLQSYGF, and RFDNPALPF exhibited significant improvement in binding affinity than their dominant counterpart, however, 60% of binders did not show any binding to the allele. Interestingly, two of the dominant equivalents of the 60% binders i.e. NYNYLYRLF and IYSKHTPINL also didn\\u2019t exhibit any binding to the HLA-A*24:02 allele, and the docking score noted for the other two dominant alleles, i.e. YFPLQSYGF and VLNDILSRL were low. However, the paired-t test showed no significant difference in the binding affinity between the dominant and mutant alleles (\\np\\n>\\u20090.05).\\nTable 3\\nDocking score of the dominant-mutant epitope pair with the most abundant MHC-I alleles.\\nA*0201\\n(PDBid: 4U6Y)\\nA*0101\\n(PDBid: 4NQX)\\nA*0301\\n(PDBid: 6O9C)\\nB*0702\\n(PDBid: 6VMX)\\nA*2402\\n(PDBid: 7EJM)\\nDominant / mutant\\nDocking score (Kcal/mol)\\nCNDPFLGVYY/CNDPFLDVYY\\n-\\n-10.63/-9.04\\n-\\n-\\n-\\nLPPAYTNSF/RTQSYTNSF\\n-\\n-9.78/-9.91\\n-\\n-11.82/-11.96\\n-8.96/-10.76\\nYFPLQSYGF/YFPLRSYSF\\n-\\n-\\n-\\n-\\n-4.77/-10.49\\nYFPLQSYGF/YSPLQSYGF\\n-\\n-\\n-\\n-\\n-4.77/-8.29\\nYFPLQSYGF/YFPLRSYGF\\n-\\n-\\n-\\n-\\n-4.77/0\\nYGFQPTNGV/YSFRPTYGV\\n-9.84/-10.77\\n-\\n-\\n-\\n-\\nNLDSKVGGNY/KLDSKVSGNY\\n-\\n-10.57/-11.48\\n-10.67/-9.58\\n-\\n-\\nNLDSKVGGNY/KLDSKVGGNY\\n-\\n-10.57/-9.62\\n-10.67/-9.62\\n-\\n-\\nNLDSKVGGNY/KLDSTVGGNY\\n-\\n-10.57/-9.43\\n-10.67/-10.48\\n-\\n-\\nNLDSKVGGNY/KLDSKPSGNY\\n-\\n-10.57/-10.76\\n-10.67/-11.17\\n-\\n-\\nRFDNPVLPF/RFDNPALPF\\n-\\n-9.71/-9.97\\n-\\n-\\n-9.29/-12.28\\nRLFRKSNLK/RLFRKSKLK\\n-\\n-\\n-9/-7.17\\n-\\n-\\nYQDVNCTEV/YQGVNCTEV\\n-10.44/-10.9\\n-\\n-\\n-\\n-\\nCVADYSVLY/CVADYSVIY\\n-\\n-9.45/-9.56\\n-\\n-\\n-\\nCNDPFLGVY/CNDPFLDVY\\n-\\n-9.9/-10.31\\n-\\n-\\n-\\nVLNDILSRL/VLNDIFSRL\\n-9.98/-11.38\\n-\\n-\\n-\\n-4.8/0\\nGVYFASTEK/GVYFASIEK\\n-\\n-\\n-10.18/-10.24\\n-\\n-\\nTPINLVRDL/TPINLGRDL\\n-\\n-\\n-\\n-10.64/-9.99\\n-\\nTPINLVRDL/TPVNLGRDL\\n-\\n-\\n-\\n-10.64/-9.52\\n-\\nTPINLVRDL/TPINLERDL\\n-\\n-\\n-\\n-10.64/-9.24\\n-\\nKIADYNYKL/NIADYNYKL\\n-10.18/-10.81\\n-\\n-\\n-\\n-\\nFCNDPFLGVYY/FCNDPFLDVYY\\n-\\n-9.72/-8.04\\n-\\n-\\n-\\nIGAEHVNNSY/IGAEYVNNSY\\n-\\n-12.12/-12.28\\n-\\n-\\n-\\nKSWMESEFRVY/KSRMESELRVY\\n-8.51/-8.31\\nNSASFSTFK/NLAPFFTFK\\n-\\n-\\n-8.3/-10.09\\n-\\n-\\nNSASFSTFK/NFAPFFAFK\\n-\\n-\\n-8.3/-11.8\\n-\\n-\\nFCNDPFLGVY/FCNDPFLDVY\\n-\\n-11.24/-9.3\\n-\\n-\\n-\\nThe docking study was conducted for binders to validate the binding of the dominant-mutant pair with the globally prevalent MHC-I alleles. The remaining pairs are indicated with a \\u201c-\\u201c symbol.\\nFurther, stability analysis\\nvia\\nmolecular dynamics (MD) simulation was performed for one of the dominant-mutant pairs, YGFQPTNGV-YSFRPTYGV showing binding with the most frequently present allele, HLA-A*02:01 allele (Fig.\\n4\\n). The RMSD plot showed that the dominant and mutant epitope-allele complexes maintained a stable frame from 65 ns onwards with an approximate deviation within 3 \\u00c5 indicating the stability of the complexes. Additional MD simulation analysis of one of the dominant-nonbinder pairs, IGAEHVNNSY-IGAEYVNNSY with the HLA-A*02:01 allele was also performed. The RMSD value noted for the dominant-allele complex was around 2.5 \\u00c5 (beyond 60 ns) whereas, the simulation trajectory showed significant fluctuation (maximum around 7 \\u00c5) for the non-binder epitope-allele, demonstrating unstable binding of the epitope, thus corroborating the initial finding (Supplementary Fig.\\nS2\\n).\\nCross reactive CD8\\u2009+\\u2009T cell epitopes\\nWe utilized NetMHCpan 4.1 with a rank range of 0-0.5, along with other parameters including MHC-I immunogenicity predictor, AllerTop 2.0, VaxiJen 2.0, ToxinPred, and ProtParam. These components were applied according to a previously outlined protocol to selectively identify CD8\\u2009+\\u2009T cell epitopes that are immunogenic, antigenic, non-toxic, and stable. We compared these predicted reference SARS-CoV-2 immunogenic epitopes to the epitopes of other omicron variants to identify possible cross-reactive epitopes. The search resulted in the discovery of 48 epitopes that were immunogenic, antigenic, non-allergenic, and non-toxic. Twenty-eight of these epitopes were found to be stable in vivo, while others were identified as unstable (see supplementary Tables\\nS4\\nand\\nS5\\nrespectively). Additionally, we assessed the preservation of these epitopes within the context of Alpha (B.1.1.7), Beta (B.1.351), Gamma (P.1), and Delta (B.1.617.2) VOCs and compared our findings with the outcomes of the previously conducted study\\n40\\n. It was determined that all 28 epitopes remained conserved across previous Variants of Concern. Among these, ten epitopes also exhibited conservation within US variants and Cluster 5 mink variants, as already documented (as detailed in Supplementary Table\\nS2\\n). These epitopes hold the potential to be included in a multi-vaccine strategy, targeting multiple variants simultaneously.\\nCross-reactive CD4\\u2009+\\u2009T cell epitopes\\nUsing NetMHCIIpan v.4.0 with a 1% rank threshold and taking into account factors such as IFNEpitope, VaxiJen 2.0, AllerTop 2.0, and ToxinPred, we exclusively selected CD4\\u2009+\\u2009epitopes that meet the criteria of being non-allergenic, non-toxic, and capable of inducing IFN\\u03b3. The same methodology used for cross-reactive CD8\\u2009+\\u2009epitopes was applied in this selection process.\\nSince there was no dedicated immunogenicity server available for CD4\\u2009+\\u2009peptides, we utilized the IFNEpitope server to predict MHC-II peptides that have the potential to induce IFN\\u03b3-inducing epitopes. Our comprehensive investigation yielded 21 common S-specific CD4\\u2009+\\u2009T cell cross-reactive epitopes that are found across all omicron variants, as well as six other SARS-CoV-2 variants. Among these 21 epitopes, thirteen were predicted to be stable based on in-vivo studies (refer to Supplementary Tables\\nS6\\nand\\nS7\\n).\\nIn-silico vaccine designing\\nIn order to formulate a candidate vaccine construct, we selected predicted cross reactive T-cell specific epitopes (CD8\\u2009+\\u2009and CD4+) using the strict criteria detailed above, following a comprehensive assessment of their interactions and antigenicity. The CD8\\u2009+\\u2009specific epitopes were subjected to docking and MMGBSA analysis for the five most prevalent HLA-I alleles. The criteria for epitope selection in vaccine design encompassed the consideration of number of interacting alleles and antigenicity levels (threshold\\u2009>\\u20090.7) (see Supplementary Tables\\nS10\\nand\\nS11\\n). A total of eight cross-reactive T-cell specific epitopes (5 CD8\\u2009+\\u2009and 3 CD4+) were shortlisted for vaccine design, utilizing universal linkers vaccine (viz. EAAAK, AAY, and GPGPG) (as shown in Supplementary Fig.\\nS3\\n). Despite using a stringent threshold that limited the number of epitopes with high population coverage, the selected epitopes still cover a substantial portion of the global population. The global human population coverage of the combined CTL and HTL epitopes were estimated to be 99.22% (Supplementary Fig.\\nS4\\n). The sequence of the vaccine construct predicted to be non-allergenic and antigenic (0.7884) was used as input for immune profiling using C-ImmSim server. Immune simulation demonstrated that the potential vaccine candidate primarily produced large amounts of IgM\\u2009+\\u2009IgG antibodies following antigen suppression. On the other hand, among cytokines, INF-\\u03b3 showed the most significant elevation in production. In general, the findings indicate that the construct has the potential to trigger both humoral and cellular immune reactions (Supplementary Fig.\\nS5\\n). Further designing of other constructs including conserved immunodominant epitopes delineated in supplementary table S8 and S9 may be undertaken, for potential combinations including diverse proteins.\\nDiscussion\\nThe ongoing concern is the potential emergence of a future variant of SARS-CoV-2 that possesses the ability to evade T cells. As SARS-CoV-2 evolves and becomes more adept at entering cells, it may also acquire additional advantageous characteristics, such as evading T cell recognition, thereby increasing its pathogenicity\\n34\\n. Investigating the variation and preservation of T cell responses across different strains can offer valuable insights into the possibility of cellular immune evasion, the molecular mechanisms involved, and the implications for vaccine efficacy. While considerable research has focused on understanding how mutations in SARS-CoV-2 impact antibody recognition, our understanding of their effects on T cell targets remains limited. Consequently, the ability to promptly assess the influence of mutations on T cell responses would help alleviate uncertainties when novel VOCs emerge.\\nIn this study, employing insights into T cell epitopes that have been recognized in individuals either infected with COVID-19 or vaccinated, we offer here a preliminary exploration of the strength of T cell responses against Omicron variants. The epitopes originating from the S protein were our primary focus. Since many COVID-19 vaccines include S-specific antigens, this is most relevant in regards to the T cell responses induced by those vaccinations. Additionally, it has been shown that during a natural infection, T cell responses to S are immunodominant\\n41\\n. In this analysis, we examined all of 143 CD8\\u2009+\\u2009and 139 CD4\\u2009+\\u2009spike-specific T cell dominant epitopes that are accessible at IEDB (accessed on May26, 2023)\\n42\\n,\\n43\\nand screened them for VOCs characterizing mutations (obtained from\\nhttps://outbreak.info\\nand GISAID database)\\n44\\n,\\n45\\n. Our study utilized a combination of sequence homology, epitope prediction techniques and molecular docking analysis to assess the effects of mutations on the T cell immune response. Specifically, we conducted a comparison between the dominant epitopes of SARS-CoV-2 and the sequences of variant strains. This analysis aimed to identify and locate the dominant epitopes that were influenced by the mutations present in the VOCs. Subsequently, we utilized an epitope prediction method to analyse the mutations in peptide-HLA class I and II binding in order to enhance our comprehension of how these mutations affect the T cell response. To the best of our knowledge, this specific approach, which involves conducting an extensive analysis and comparison of HLA restriction patterns for both immunodominant and mutated T cell epitopes on spike proteins across a distinct range of omicron VOCs, has not been previously investigated. The aim was to gain valuable insights into vaccine efficacy through this approach.\\nOur findings reveal that a significant portion of CD8\\u2009+\\u2009specific dominant epitopes is conserved, with conservation rates of 83% in BA.1, 86% in BA.2, 84% in BA.2.12.1, BQ.1.1, and XBB.1.5, and 85% in BA.2.75 and BA.5. In contrast, CD4\\u2009+\\u2009specific dominant epitopes appear to be less conserved compared to CD8\\u2009+\\u2009dominant epitopes. We observed conservation rates of only 71% in BA.1, BA.2.12.1, BA.2.75, 74% in BA.2, 70% in BA.5, and 68% and 67% in BQ.1.1 and XBB.1.5, respectively. According to our analysis, the investigation of SARS-CoV-2 Omicron variants reveals that the majority of CD8\\u2009+\\u2009and CD4\\u2009+\\u2009T cell epitopes derived from the spike protein remain unchanged and conserved. The epitopes that remain unchanged across various variants hold particular significance (as demonstrated in supplementary tables S8 and S9) since they can be recognized as minimally mutating immunogenic regions, suitable for devising a comprehensive efficacy strategy. The spike protein of omicron sub-lineages has approximately 18 identical mutations in the BA.1, BA.2, BA.2.12.1, BA.2.75, BA.5, BQ.1.1, and XBB.1.5 variants. However, each sub lineage carries a small number of mutations that are distinctive from previous omicron sub lineages.\\nIn order to assess the impact of specific mutations present in the Omicron variant on HLA restriction and immune evasion, we conducted an analysis on mutation-containing epitopes derived from the VOCs. Our study unveiled prominent CD8\\u2009+\\u2009and CD4\\u2009+\\u2009T cell epitopes derived from the S protein of SARS-CoV-2, specifically targeting the Omicron variants. Several significant mutations, including Del69-70, T95I, G142D, Del143-145, del211, L212I, G339D, S371L, S373P, S375F, K417N, N440K, G446S, S477N, T478K, E484A, Q493R, G496S, Q498R, N501Y, Y505H, and T547K etc., were noted in this study. These mutations are already known to enhance infectivity and facilitate immune evasion by the VOCs\\n37\\n,\\n46\\n\\u2013\\n48\\n.\\nWe identified several identical mutations and deletions such as A67V, Del69-70, G142D, Del143-145, N211-, L212I, INS214EPE that resulted in peptide non-binding to class I and class II HLAs, as illustrated in the Tables\\n1\\nand\\n2\\n. Our analysis revealed that three out of the thirteen non-binder epitopes, namely FQPTNGVGY and GYQPYRVVVLSF in the RBD (Receptor-Binding Domain) and SPRRARSVA in the furin cleavage region, are impacted by these shared mutations found across all omicron sub-variants. These mutations have been documented to negatively affect the binding of these epitopes to specific class I alleles, as previously discussed in studies by Naranbhai et al. (2022) and Swaminathan et al. (2022)\\n35\\n,\\n49\\n. Swaminathan et al.\\u2018s previous study also showed that the presence of P681H in the SPRRARSVA epitope is detectable in multiple variants and results in an alteration of the HLA-B anchor residue at position P2, leading to a loss of recognition by T cells from vaccinated individuals\\n49\\n.\\nOn the contrary, the occurrence of mutations S477N, T478K, and E484A, along with N969K, in the receptor-binding domain of the Omicron variant\\u2019s spike protein diminishes the peptides\\u2019 ability to interact with Class II-specific HLAs. These specific mutations, namely S477N, T478K, and E484A, have demonstrated notable resistance potential to decrease the neutralizing efficacy of monoclonal antibodies, convalescent plasma, and vaccine-induced serum\\n50\\n,\\n51\\n. Taken together, the available evidence indicates that these mutations may enable the epitopes to evade the T cell response. Nevertheless, it is noteworthy that despite the XBB.1.5 variant having a higher number of mutations compared to other previously circulating variants, these mutations do not seem to impact the T cell dominant epitopes. Consequently, the majority of the T-cell responses remains intact.\\nIn our study, besides the overall mutational changes, most of these mutated epitopes in omicron variants were anticipated to exhibit similar or diminished and even enhanced or different restriction patterns as compared to their dominant counterparts (refer to Tables\\n1\\nand\\n2\\n). These observations aligned with the results obtained in molecular docking analysis. For instance, in certain alleles viz. HLA-A*01:01, HLA-A*03:01, HLA-B*07:02, and HLA-A*24:02 increased, equivalent, reduced, or loss of binding were noted for the mutant epitopes when compared to their corresponding dominant epitopes, whereas, in HLA-A*02:01 allele, enhancement in binding affinity was observed for all the binders. This finding indicates their continued ability to initiate a T cell response. This suggests that memory T cells are unlikely to be weakened when encountering different SARS-CoV-2 variants during reinfection or when infected by one of the SARS-CoV-2 variants following vaccination. The finding was supported by the statistical analysis as well.\\nTo date various studies have been conducted to investigate the T cell cross recognition against new SARS-CoV-2 variants most of which have revealed an uncompromised T cell response\\n52\\n\\u2013\\n57\\n. Arguably, Some studies suggest that mutated epitopes in the variants of SARS-CoV-2 may cause diminished CD4\\u2009+\\u2009and CD8\\u2009+\\u2009T cell responses against them\\n30\\n,\\n32\\n,\\n37\\n,\\n46\\n. A study by Tarke et al. examined the T-cell response against various COVID-19 variants, including B.1.1.7, B.1.351, P.1, and CAL.20\\u00a0C, in convalescent individuals and those vaccinated with Moderna or Pfizer/BioNTech vaccines. They observed only a 10\\u201322% decline in T-cell reactivity and observed that only a small percentage (7%) of CD4\\u2009+\\u2009and CD8\\u2009+\\u2009T-cell epitopes were affected by mutations in the studied variants. Therefore, it is expected that vaccines will still retain efficacy against these variants\\n56\\n. Likewise, there have been limited studies that have explored the CD4\\u2009+\\u2009and/or CD8\\u2009+\\u2009T cell responses within clinical settings towards different SARS-CoV-2 variants, encompassing the Omicron variant as well\\n53\\n\\u2013\\n60\\n. Our findings align with the studies conducted by Geers et al. 2021 and Tarke et al.\\n56\\n,\\n60\\n.\\nAdditionally, we also identified 28 immunogenic, nontoxic, antigenic, non-allergenic and stable CD8\\u2009+\\u2009and 13 CD4\\u2009+\\u2009T cell cross reactive epitopes of wild-type SARS-CoV-2 across the Omicron sub-variants. With the recent development of integrated bioinformatics and immune-informatics approaches, the process of vaccine design has become faster and more cost-effective. Epitope-based vaccines offer an enduring immune response, surpassing the relatively short-lived immunity of mRNA vaccines that have been observed to decrease after six months of vaccination\\n61\\n. In this study, we developed a vaccine construct using conserved and immunogenic epitopes of SARS-CoV-2 across all variants, and evaluated the resulting immune response. The results suggest the potential of this vaccine construct to elicit an immune response effective against multiple SARS-CoV-2 variants concurrently.\\nComputational analyses of HLA-peptide binding affinity suggest that some anticipated altered epitopes in the Omicron spike protein may no longer be able to bind to HLA molecules. Therefore, it is plausible that spike variation in Omicron VOCs modifies important residues necessary for HLA binding, mediating escape from specific HLA-restricted T cell responses elicited by earlier infections and vaccinations. The maintenance of spike-specific T cell responses, as observed in the study, is likely attributed to the conserved sequence similarity and the comparison of experimentally verified epitopes and the predicted binding affinity of T cell epitopes between the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein and Omicron VOCs across a globally representative set of alleles. However, it must be noted that any predicted mutant-HLA complex may or may not exhibit T cell receptor binding, which would require more validation in the future. More focused investigations are needed to establish the robustness of T cell responses against Omicron variants and to assess the ability of particular epitope alterations to confer T cell escape. Despite this, our study suggests that the efficiency of innate T cell immunity is most likely unaffected by Omicron mutations because the majority of experimental T cell epitopes known to be targeted in immunised and/or previously infected individuals are unaffected. However, T cell responses alone cannot prevent infection or transmission. Although Omicron\\u2019s potential to evade antibodies may lead to a significant increase in infections, strong T cell immunity offers hope that the level of protection against severe illness will remain high, as has been the case with other VOCs.\\nConclusion\\nBased on our in-silico analysis, we can conclude that T cell immunity exhibits a notable level of effectiveness against Variants of Concern (VOCs) of SARS-CoV-2. Despite the presence of mutations, the preservation of immunodominant epitopes and their binding to HLA molecules indicates that T cells generated through prior exposure or vaccination may still contribute to protection against these emerging variants. Further, considering the incorporation of cross-reactive and immunogenic CD8\\u2009+\\u2009and CD4\\u2009+\\u2009T cell epitopes in the designed vaccine construct; we believe that the same would prove efficacious against all previous and current Variants of Concern (VOCs). Overall, the study offers a comprehensive perspective on the T cell immune response, highlighting its substantial role in maintaining the potential of vaccines to mitigate the severity and fatality of diseases, even in the face of evolving variants.\\nMaterials and methods\\nSequence retrieval of Omicron variants\\nThe FASTA format sequences of the spike protein from SARS-CoV-2 omicron variants, namely BA.1, BA.2, BA.2.12.1, BA.2.75, BA.5, BQ.1.1, and omicron recombinant XBB.1.5, were obtained from the NCBI database\\n62\\n. The corresponding Accession IDs for these variants are as follows:\\nUFO69279\\n,\\nUJP23605\\n,\\nUMZ92892.1\\n,\\nUTM82166.1\\n,\\nUOZ45804\\n,\\nUWM38596.1\\n, and\\nUZG29433.1\\n. In addition, sequences of earlier VOCs including Alpha (\\nQWE88920.1\\n), Beta (\\nQRN78347.1\\n), Gamma (\\nQRX39425.1\\n), and Delta (\\nQUD52764.1\\n) were also retrieved from NCBI. To identify the mutations, present in these variants and assess their prevalence, the list of mutations was collected from freely accessible databases, namely outbreak.info and GISAID database\\n44\\n,\\n45\\n.\\nExtraction of CD8\\u2009+\\u2009and CD4\\u2009+\\u2009T cell immunodominant SARS-CoV-2 epitopes using IEDB\\nThe IEDB server was queried for experimentally generated T cell epitopes of SARS-CoV-2 (ID 2697049) for spike protein (ID\\nP0DTC2\\n) by selecting human hosts and T cell tests that were positive\\n42\\n,\\n43\\n. In this study, only dominant epitopes found in 3 or more studies/donors were considered (accessed on May 21, 2023)\\n41\\n. For MHC class I and II, respectively, we included only peptides of lengths 8\\u201314 and 15 respectively. A total of 143 and 139 dominant MHC Class I and II epitopes were thus identified in this study.\\nEpitope conservancy of SARS-CoV-2\\nIn order to determine the T cell epitopes that undergo mutations within a particular SARS-CoV-2 variant, a comparison was conducted between the sequences of dominant T cell epitopes and the spike protein sequence of each respective variant. The degree of epitope conservancy within the spike protein of VOCs was calculated at various degrees of sequence identity after the extraction of the dominant SARS-CoV-2 epitopes (\\nhttp://tools.iedb.org/conservancy/\\n)\\n63\\n. The percentage of protein sequences that cover the epitope at a specific level of identity was used to define the degree of conservation.\\nCD8\\u2009+\\u2009T cell epitope and immunogenicity prediction\\nTo ensure coverage of 90% or more individuals in an idealized population, CD8\\u2009+\\u2009T cell epitope predictions were conducted using NetMHCpan v4.1a for 27 different HLA class I alleles. The top 2% ranked epitopes, ranging in size from 8 to 14 residues, were considered as binders. For the vaccine construction, a % rank score less than 0.5 was used as the criterion for selecting the top strong binders\\n64\\n. The MHC I immunogenicity tool in IEDB.org was used to calculate the immunogenicity scores for each variant\\n65\\n. For further analysis, only CD8\\u2009+\\u2009common epitopes with an immunogenicity score\\u2009>\\u20090 were considered.\\nCD4\\u2009+\\u2009T cell epitope prediction\\nThe prediction of binding affinity and the likelihood of natural presentation was performed using NetMHCIIpan-4.0 with selected specific HLA-II alleles for all VOCs. In this analysis, the % rank score indicating the probability of natural peptide presentation (EL, eluted ligand, rank scores) was taken into consideration for each of the selected HLA-II alleles\\n64\\n,\\n66\\n. The top 5% ranking criterion was applied to identify potential 15-mer epitopes for the 25 most common HLA-II alleles. Conversely, a top 1% rank threshold was used to select the strong binders in the vaccine construct design. The selection of NetMHCpan-4.1 and NetMHCIIpan-4.0 was based on their superior performance and increased predicted accuracy compared to alternative programs. Furthermore, NetMHCpan-4.1 and NetMHCIIpan-4.0 enhance the accuracy and efficiency of their peptide-MHC interaction prediction by employing tailored machine learning methods\\n64\\n. RawGraphs was utilized for the representation of the data\\n67\\n.\\nIFN\\u03b3 inducing CD4\\u2009+\\u2009peptide prediction\\nTo address the lack of a reliable immunogenicity predictor on IEDB.org, the leading CD4 peptides were additionally refined based on their ability to induce IFN\\u03b3, utilizing the IFNEpitope server accessible at\\nhttps://webs.iiitd.edu.in/raghava/ifnepitope/index.php\\n68\\n. Epitopes that exhibited a \\u201cpositive\\u201d response in terms of IFN\\u03b3 release were exclusively chosen for subsequent analysis.\\nPrediction of antigenicity, allergenicity, toxicity of T cell epitopes\\nThe prediction of antigenic CD8\\u2009+\\u2009and CD4\\u2009+\\u2009epitopes was performed using VaxiJen v2.0, accessible at\\nhttp://www.ddg-pharmfac.net/vaxijen/VaxiJen/VaxiJen.html\\n69\\n. VaxiJen v2.0 utilizes open accessible alignment methods to evaluate the antigenicity of a protein sequence. It computes antigenicity by converting sequences into standardized vectors through auto-covariance and cross-covariance techniques, which take into account the crucial amino acid properties. A viral model was utilized, and epitopes with a score greater than 0.4 were deemed antigenic.\\nAllerTop 2.0 was employed to determine the allergenicity of CD8\\u2009+\\u2009and CD4\\u2009+\\u2009epitopes, (\\nhttp://www.pharmfac.net/allertop\\n)\\n70\\n. AllerTOP v2.0 utilizes auto- and cross-covariance (ACC) transformation, amino acid E-descriptors, and k nearest neighbor machine learning techniques to classify protein allergens. Epitopes that were identified as \\u201cprobable non-allergenic\\u201d were exclusively chosen for our analysis. Further, the ToxinPred online server at\\nhttps://webs.iiitd.edu.in/raghava/toxinpred/index.html\\nwas used to predict the toxicity of CD8\\u2009+\\u2009and CD4\\u2009+\\u2009peptides\\n71\\n.\\nAmino acid physicochemical properties\\nExPASy\\u2019s ProtParam tool (\\nhttps://web.expasy.org/protparam/\\n) was used to analyse the physical and chemical characteristics of CD8\\u2009+\\u2009and CD4\\u2009+\\u2009peptides\\n72\\n. A number of parameters were considered, including aliphatic index, stability index, Grand Average of Hydropathicity (GRAVY), and half-life. The instability index was calculated to determine the stability of epitopes in vivo, with a threshold of <\\u200940 indicating a stable epitope. Additionally, the estimation of half-life (in mammalian reticulocytes in vitro) was calculated, with a threshold value of >\\u20091\\u00a0h selected.\\nMolecular docking analysis and simulation\\nThree-dimensional structures of MHC-I alleles with the PDBids: 4U6Y, 4NQX, 6O9C, 6VMX, and 7EJM were retrieved from Protein Data Bank (PDB) (\\nhttps://www.rcsb.org/\\n)\\n73\\n. Docking of selected MHC-I alleles with their corresponding binders/ mutant epitopes was performed using peptide docking panel in Glide module of Schrodinger suite 2024\\u2009\\u2212\\u20092\\n74\\n. The docking parameter was set to generate 10 conformers per epitope and return 10 poses for a single docking run, improving the output\\u2019s accuracy. The final epitope conformer was selected by sorting the epitope-allele complex according to the best docking score (Kcal/mol). The docking of the dominant epitopes with the respective alleles was used for comparison. The statistical analysis of binding affinity (energy) differences between the wild type and mutant epitopes was performed by employing paired-t test in R software version 4.3.1.\\nFor binding stability analysis, one of the mutant epitopes (binders) and its dominant counterpart corresponding to the most prevalent MHC-I allele, HLA-A*02:01 (PDB id: 4U6Y) was progressed for molecular dynamics (MD) simulation using Desmond module\\n75\\n. MD simulation with a non-binder-dominant pair with the same allele was also conducted as a negative control. Further, the binding affinity of conserved CD8 epitopes to the above-mentioned alleles was determined\\nvia\\npeptide docking as well. Additionally, MM-GBSA analysis was carried out to ensure the precision of the result by rescoring the docked poses\\nvia\\nprediction of free binding energy.\\nPopulation coverage analysis\\nThe utilization of the IEDB population coverage tool (\\nhttp://tools.iedb.org/population/\\n) was applied in order to evaluate the population coverage of the chosen CTL and HTL epitopes across various HLA alleles in diverse global regions and globally, while also computing the combined class I and II coverage\\n76\\n.\\nIn-silico vaccine construct and immune simulation analysis\\nFor the vaccine construction, we utilized the widely adopted approach of in-silico epitope-based vaccine constructs\\n77\\n\\u2013\\n80\\n. The formulation of the in silico vaccine was achieved through the integration of the identified epitopes in conjunction with universal linkers, namely EAAAK, AAY, and GPGPG\\n80\\n.
